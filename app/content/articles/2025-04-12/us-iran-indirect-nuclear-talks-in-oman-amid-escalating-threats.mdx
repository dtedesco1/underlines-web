# US-Iran Indirect Nuclear Talks in Oman Amid Escalating Threats

On April 11, 2025, US envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi begin indirect talks in Oman to negotiate limits on Iran's nuclear program while tensions surge with veiled military threats.

#### Focusing Facts

- Talks set in Oman on April 11, 2025, with mediation by Omani officials, following a decade-long pause in high-level US-Iran negotiations.

- US President Trump warned of potential military strikes if Iran does not curb its enrichment, and European nations are considering snapback sanctions before the October 18 deadline.

- Discrepancies persist over direct versus indirect negotiation modes as Iranian officials insist on mediator-facilitated dialogue while US statements hint at face-to-face talks.

#### Context

This moment echoes the 2015 JCPOA negotiations, where a historic accord was reached to limit Iran’s nuclear drive in exchange for relief from international sanctions. The current talks, marred by Trump’s renewed military rhetoric and the US unilateral withdrawal in 2018, reflect a long-standing pattern of negotiation under pressure seen in earlier confrontations like the prelude to the 2003 Iraq War. Over a century, the interplay between diplomatic engagement and military brinkmanship in US-Middle East policy has repeatedly demonstrated that even when crises seem imminent, diplomacy endures as a means to manage power balances and avert escalation on a century-long strategic scale.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Iranian pro-diplomacy advocates**: They interpret the upcoming talks as a genuine opportunity for Iran to secure a 'real and fair' deal without succumbing to US bullying, emphasizing diplomacy over confrontation. This narrative, promoted by Iranian state-linked outlets, may downplay internal challenges and portray the regime in a more favorable light to justify its negotiating stance.

- **US/Israeli hawkish voices**: They view the negotiations as a high-stakes bargaining process where tough military threats and demands for dismantlement are necessary to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions. This perspective may exaggerate the threat posed by Iran to justify aggressive policies and military options, aligning with strategic and political interests in the region.

- **European diplomatic critics**: They see the US unilateral approach, including sidelining key European allies, as undermining a coordinated and effective diplomatic strategy on Iran. This view can overlook shared Western security objectives and might amplify European grievances to press for greater influence in negotiations.
