# Trump Halts Global Tariff Escalation, Intensifies Pressure on China

On April 9, 2025, President Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause for over 75 non-retaliatory trading partners with a reduced 10% duty, while immediately escalating tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump’s 90-day tariff pause applies to over 75 countries who engaged in trade negotiations, with tariffs reduced to 10% effective immediately.

- Tariffs on Chinese goods were raised to 125% effective immediately, with the total U.S. tariff on China reaching 145% including previous hikes.

- China retaliated by raising its tariffs on U.S. imports from 84% to 125%, effective April 12, 2025.

#### Context

This episode mirrors historical protectionist turns like the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which also sparked global economic tensions. However, the modern landscape—dominated by interconnected supply chains and strategic geopolitical maneuvers—adds complexity to the conflict. The Trump administration’s dual strategy of pausing tariffs broadly while singling out China reflects a longstanding pattern in American economic nationalism and power projection. In the long term, despite short-term market jitters and trade turbulence, such maneuvers may merely represent a rebalancing of global trade relationships rather than an irreversible break, much like past trade wars that eventually paved the way for new forms of international cooperation.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: These articles stress that President Trump’s firm trade stance and willingness to retaliate showcase American strength and are paving the way for favorable bilateral deals. They often emphasize economic and geopolitical victories, potentially overlooking negative fallout or the complexities of trade negotiations for the sake of reinforcing a pro-administration narrative.

- **Trade Escalation Concern**: This group views the actions as an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, highlighting retaliatory measures such as China’s tariff increases as a signal of deepening conflict. It often frames the situation as an inevitably worsening conflict and may overemphasize the risks of long-term economic instability to suit a narrative of global repercussions.

- **Chinese state-affiliated and regional media**: These sources portray the U.S. tariffs as excessive 'maximum pressure' rooted in capricious behavior, urging an end to aggressive policies in favor of dialogue based on equality and mutual benefit. They tend to frame the narrative to defend China’s reactive measures and political stance, potentially minimizing the criticisms of China’s own trade practices and internal challenges.

- **Centrist/Investigative outlets**: This perspective questions the administration’s optimistic claims and scrutinizes inconsistencies, such as why direct communication with China is lacking, reflecting uncertainty about the effectiveness of Trump’s strategy. There is a risk of under-emphasizing the administration’s achievements while over-focusing on its rhetorical ambiguities, potentially aiming for a more nuanced but skeptical stance.
