# Witkoff’s Third Moscow Visit Deepens US Rift Over Ukraine Ceasefire

On April 11, 2025, US special envoy Steve Witkoff held his third high-stakes meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow as President Trump pressed for a swift ceasefire in Ukraine amid mounting internal disagreements.

#### Focusing Facts

- Witkoff’s meeting with Putin was his third this year, aiming to break the deadlock over Ukraine’s conflict.

- Discussions included a proposal to transfer control of four eastern Ukrainian regions to Russia alongside reports of a four-hour meeting and dinner protocol breaches.

- A recent prisoner exchange released dual US-Russian citizen Ksenia Karelina, and Trump warned of potential new sanctions if a ceasefire isn’t reached by month’s end.

#### Context

This event echoes past diplomatic gambits such as the 1970s détente, where high-level meetings sought to defuse global tensions amidst deep-seated ideological divides. The persistent reliance on envoy diplomacy, despite evident splits within the US administration—highlighted by contrasting views between Witkoff and other officials—reflects a continuity in balancing executive urgency with geopolitical strategy. While this moment may shape immediate conflict resolution in Ukraine, its long-term significance is intertwined with historical trends of fluctuating US foreign policy commitments and the persistent challenges of negotiating with adversaries, a theme that has recurred over the last century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Administration Diplomatic Advocates**: They emphasize that continued high-level engagement, as seen in Witkoff’s repeated meetings with Putin, is crucial to restarting peace talks and ultimately brokering a ceasefire in Ukraine. This perspective may downplay the risks of appearing too conciliatory with Russia and could be overly optimistic about the outcomes of diplomatic engagement.

- **Republican Hawks and Critics**: They argue that the envoy’s approach, including embracing Russian demands, dangerously undercuts U.S. and Ukrainian strategic interests and effectively lines up with Kremlin perspectives. This view is driven by partisan concerns and a hawkish stance that might exaggerate the concessions made to Russia while dismissing diplomatic nuances.
