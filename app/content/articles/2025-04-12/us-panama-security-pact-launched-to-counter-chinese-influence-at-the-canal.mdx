# US-Panama Security Pact Launched to Counter Chinese Influence at the Canal

On April 9-10, 2025, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Panamanian officials formalized a security agreement emphasizing toll-free, prioritized transit for U.S. warships and joint military exercises aimed at countering alleged Chinese surveillance and influence in the canal region.

#### Focusing Facts

- A memorandum of understanding and framework agreement were signed, ensuring U.S. warships receive 'first and free' passage through the Panama Canal.

- The U.S. deployed troops and the hospital ship USNS Comfort to Panama, initiating enhanced joint training and security cooperation.

- An audit of the Panama Ports lease revealed contract breaches and nearly $1.2 billion in unpaid dues linked to foreign (China-related) infrastructure control.

#### Context

This development echoes a century-long tug-of-war over the strategic Panama Canal. Just as President Teddy Roosevelt’s 1906 inspection underscored America’s resolve to secure the canal—a project that cost tens of thousands of lives—the recent pact signals a modern reassertion of U.S. influence amid rising Chinese global ambitions and debt-trap diplomacy. While the agreement reinforces the longstanding principle of Panamanian sovereignty over the canal, it also reflects long-term trends in geopolitics where infrastructure and military positioning are leveraged as tools of economic and strategic dominance. Over the next 100 years, such maneuvers may either solidify a stable balance of power in the Western Hemisphere or further polarize great-power competition, with profound implications for global trade and security.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: They frame the Panama Canal as being under direct threat from Chinese influence and argue that the U.S. must reassert its control—often invoking phrases like 'taking back' the canal—to safeguard American security and economic interests. This perspective is infused with nationalist rhetoric and aligns with a hardline, pro-Trump agenda that may exaggerate the threat from China to justify aggressive foreign policy moves.

- **Chinese state–aligned perspective**: They challenge U.S. claims by asserting that China has no operational or manipulative role in the Panama Canal, and portray U.S. statements as an attempt to undermine legitimate Chinese-Panamanian cooperation. This stance is influenced by geopolitical interests that favor maintaining China’s image and countering U.S. criticisms, potentially downplaying any strategic implications of Chinese business practices in the region.
