# Global AI Convergence: Faith, Policy, and Industry in a Transformative Era

In early April 2025, AI’s permeation across realms—from a theological summit in Texas to sweeping federal policy shifts and creative industry innovation—signals a multidimensional transformation of society and work.

#### Focusing Facts

- Missional AI 2025 in Plano, Texas, gathered over 500 participants from 100+ organizations across 30 countries to explore AI’s ethical and spiritual implications.

- The Trump administration has frozen or scaled back billions in federal research grants, directly impacting U.S. AI innovation and university-funded training that sparked breakthroughs like ChatGPT and AlphaFold.

- Shopify now mandates generative AI usage for its 8,100 employees, reflecting a broader trend of integrating AI tools in workplace productivity.

#### Context

This convergence mirrors historical shifts such as the electrification revolution of the early 20th century, where new technology redefined every facet of life. Today, AI’s broad reach—stretching from debates about divine inspiration in Bible translation to national security warnings and creative disruptions in Hollywood—illustrates systemic changes across industries, government policy, and cultural norms. As funding paradigms shift and global players like China and emerging markets like India push for contextually relevant, bias‐free models, this era could redefine how societies organize labor, manage creativity, and secure digital and physical infrastructures over the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Faith-Based Technologists**: They interpret AI as a divinely guided tool that can augment human mission and spiritual practices, emphasizing that technology should serve to reduce mundane tasks while empowering people and church work. This perspective may overly stress spiritual integration in technology and downplay secular or ethical complexities by framing AI advancements as part of a divine plan.

- **National Competitiveness and Policy Critics**: They argue that current U.S. government policies—whether by cutting research funding or through flawed administrative decisions—risk undermining America’s long-term leadership in AI, especially relative to rivals like China. This view can be colored by partisan or nationalistic agendas, focusing on policy failures and competitive threats while possibly oversimplifying broader global dynamics and the role of private sector innovation.

- **Economic Impact and Workforce Debaters**: One camp promotes AI as a driver of efficiency and competitive edge in business—transforming job roles and saving resources—while its critics warn of massive job displacement and deepening economic inequality. Proponents may understate the human cost and social challenges of automation, whereas critics might emphasize job loss and economic disruption without fully accounting for productivity gains or market adaptability.
