# EU Suspends Tariffs and Eyes Digital Tax Amid 90-Day Trade Pause

On April 11, 2025, the EU, led by Ursula von der Leyen, suspended planned countermeasures on €20.9 billion in US exports to align with Trump's 90-day tariff pause, while warning that digital countermeasures targeting tech giants could follow if negotiations falter.

#### Focusing Facts

- EU suspended tariffs on €20.9bn of US exports on April 11, 2025, pending negotiations.

- Trump reduced his tariff rate from 20% to a baseline 10% and earlier imposed 25% tariffs on EU steel, aluminum, and autos.

- The EU signaled potential levies on digital ad revenues for US tech giants like Google and Meta.

#### Context

This measured EU response recalls the cautious counter-tariff approaches of the 1980s, where targeted measures were deployed to offset protectionist pressures without triggering full-scale trade wars. Much like the period’s carefully calibrated negotiations between major economies, the current actions reflect a long-term trend toward balancing national interests in an era of global interconnectedness. Over the next century, strategic shifts—such as leveraging anti-coercion instruments and diversifying trade partnerships—could redefine international trade norms, echoing historic transformations seen in the post-World War II economic order.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Pro-negotiation EU officials**: They focus on engaging in negotiations with the US while keeping the door open for measured retaliatory actions, emphasizing dialogue over immediate escalation. This perspective may downplay the urgency of the US tariffs and is influenced by a desire to maintain cohesion within the EU and avoid confrontation.

- **Hawkish Trade Retaliation Advocates**: They emphasize that the EU is prepared to deploy aggressive countermeasures, including targeting US digital giants with new taxes and tariffs if negotiations falter. This stance might exaggerate the potential for escalation to support a hardline trade policy narrative and justify strong retaliatory measures.

- **Cautious Policy Planners**: They warn that overly aggressive measures, particularly against Big Tech, could backfire by harming domestic interests and that any retaliation should be measured. This view may be overly conservative, influenced by domestic concerns and the interests of countries heavily reliant on American digital services, potentially underestimating the leverage of firm countermeasures.
