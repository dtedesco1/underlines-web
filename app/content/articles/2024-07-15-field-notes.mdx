# Field Notes from the Lab

We're back with fresh highlights from the Underlines research lab. This shorter update demonstrates how plain Markdown files live alongside MDX editions.

## Highlights

1. Documentation is now powered by automatic index selection.
2. Dropping a new `.mdx` file into `app/content/articles/` makes it the latest issue.
3. The homepage always renders the newest file based on its modified time.

Stay tuned for more discoveries.
