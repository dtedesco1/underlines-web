# EU Enforces DMA on Google and Apple Amid Trump Tariff Threats

On March 19, 2025, EU regulators aggressively pressed ahead with enforcement actions under the Digital Markets Act against Google for search self-preferencing and Apple for restricting interoperability – despite direct tariff threats from President Trump.

#### Focusing Facts

- EU preliminarily charged Alphabet for favoring its own search services and restricting developer choices, risking fines up to 10-20% of global revenue.

- Apple was ordered to open key iOS connectivity features (NFC, AirDrop, notifications, etc.) to third-party devices to improve market competition.

- The measures come amid legal deadlines and broader investigations including similar actions against Meta, with potential fines estimated up to $35B, while Trump warns of retaliatory tariffs.

#### Context

Historically, major regulatory interventions such as the US antitrust cases against Microsoft (late 1990s) reshaped how tech monopolies operate, and the EU’s early 2000s interventions marked the beginning of sustained oversight of digital giants. The DMA enforcement reflects a broader, long-term shift towards increased scrutiny of tech market power, catalyzed by globalization and changing geopolitical dynamics. This moment, though a reaction to immediate competitive harms and transatlantic tensions, could reshape digital markets over the next century by establishing new norms for competition and interoperability. As with past antitrust measures, these regulatory actions may set enduring precedents that challenge entrenched business models and influence global trade rules.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **EU Regulatory Advocates**: They interpret the EU’s actions against Apple and Google as necessary enforcement of competition laws to safeguard consumer choice and market fairness. This perspective can understate the regulatory risk to innovation and may lean on legal formalism while glossing over the political tensions with the U.S. leadership.

- **Tech Industry Critics**: They view the EU's Digital Markets Act enforcement as overreaching regulation that hinders innovation and complicates user experience by imposing burdensome rules on companies like Apple and Google. This stance often emphasizes potential operational setbacks and risks to innovation, possibly downplaying the benefits of competition enforcement and consumer protection.
