# U.S.-Brokered India-Pakistan Ceasefire Reached, Then Breached Within Hours

On 10 May 2025 a ceasefire negotiated by U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and announced by President Trump took effect at 17:00 IST, but within roughly three hours blasts and drone sightings in Srinagar marked its first confirmed violation.

#### Focusing Facts

- Ceasefire terms were agreed during overnight calls and publicly announced by Trump at 08:00 ET (17:00 IST start time) on 10 May 2025, with both DGMOs ordered to halt all land, air, and sea operations.

- By the evening of 10 May Chief Minister Omar Abdullah reported city-wide explosions; India later stated two soldiers were killed in the preceding 24 hours despite the truce.

- The Indian and Pakistani DGMOs scheduled a follow-up call for 12:00 on 12 May 2025 to assess compliance.

#### Context

Rapid, externally-mediated ceasefires between Delhi and Islamabad have a frail track record: the 26 Nov 2003 LoC truce—also midwifed by Washington—was repeatedly pierced within weeks, much like the Simla-Accords cease-line of 1972 that unraveled by 1973. The 2025 deal fits this pattern of episodic escalation, outside pressure, abrupt pause, and immediate slippage, reflecting the unresolved structural drivers: Kashmiri militancy, domestic political incentives, and a nuclear overhang that invites third-party intervention. That the United States, deep into its own election cycle, again cast itself as indispensable mediator underscores a century-long trend of extra-regional powers steering South Asian crises to avert nuclear risk while preserving their own leverage. Whether this moment matters in 2125 depends on whether Delhi and Islamabad institutionalize real de-escalatory mechanisms—something their predecessors have failed to do over five decades—or whether it becomes yet another brief armistice destined for the footnotes of a protracted rivalry.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US conservative media (e.g., Fox News, Breitbart, RedState)**: Present the ceasefire primarily as a diplomatic victory engineered by the Trump administration after an intensive White House push. By foregrounding Trump’s role and labeling him the “Peace President,” outlets bolster a pro-Trump narrative and understate the autonomy of Indian and Pakistani decision-makers.

- **Indian national broadcast outlets (e.g., NDTV)**: Highlight Pakistan’s immediate ceasefire violations while applauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi for decisive leadership and international praise. The framing stresses Pakistani aggression and credits Modi, reinforcing a nationalist storyline while giving scant attention to U.S. mediation or Indian strategic misgivings.

- **Indian strategic hawks/commentators (e.g., India Today interview with Brahma Chellaney)**: Criticise the truce as India 'snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,' arguing New Delhi squandered clear military leverage. This hard-line posture prioritises maximalist security goals and may discount diplomatic or escalation risks to press for a more aggressive stance toward Pakistan.
