# Lula Touches Down in Beijing for China-CELAC Summit, Testing U.S. Grip on Latin America

On 10 May 2025 Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva began a five-day state visit to China ahead of the 13 May China-CELAC ministerial forum, marking the first time a sitting CELAC chair attends Beijing with multiple leaders amid an escalating U.S.–China tariff standoff.

#### Focusing Facts

- Lula’s trip – his third in 24 months – is slated to produce over a dozen trade and investment deals and follows bilateral commerce that hit US$94 billion in 2024.

- Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he will sign a ‘letter of intent’ to join the Belt and Road Initiative during the Beijing meetings, a move Washington has warned could trigger trade retaliation.

- China-Latin America merchandise trade reached roughly US$519 billion in 2024, doubling the value of a decade earlier.

#### Context

A century ago, the 1823 Monroe Doctrine set the expectation that outside powers would stay clear of the Western Hemisphere; yet, like the 1955 Bandung Conference where newly de-colonised states sought alternatives to Cold-War blocs, Latin American leaders are again canvassing options beyond Washington. Persistent patterns—commodity dependence on rising industrial powers (think Britain’s 19th-century appetite for Argentine beef or Japan’s 1970s hunger for Brazilian iron ore)—re-emerge, now with China underwriting soy, copper and railways. Trump’s 145 % tariffs echo the Smoot-Hawley wave of 1930 that pushed exporters to seek new markets, and Beijing is exploiting the opening to knit infrastructure and political goodwill through BRI. If sustained, the forum could signal an inflection point where U.S. hemispheric primacy, nearly unchallenged since 1898, gives way to a more multipolar order in the Americas—an adjustment that, over a 100-year horizon, may matter less for any single soybean contract than for the precedent that outside capital and diplomacy can bypass Washington’s veto in its former “backyard.”

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western liberal financial press (e.g., Financial Times, The New York Times)**: They depict Latin American moves toward China as a high-stakes balancing act that may trigger U.S. retaliation and deepen great-power rivalry in the region. Coverage foregrounds Washington’s strategic worries and market impacts, so it can overstate U.S. leverage and underplay the agency Latin American governments feel they possess.

- **Chinese state-aligned media (e.g., South China Morning Post, RTHK)**: Reports frame Xi’s summit with Lula and other CELAC leaders as China standing with Latin America against U.S. ‘bullying’ and unilateral sanctions while deepening ‘win-win’ cooperation. Language echoes Chinese foreign-ministry talking points, portraying Beijing as benevolent and glossing over concerns about dependency, debt or political strings attached to Chinese investment.

- **Global wire services and business outlets focused on trade gains (e.g., Reuters, Yahoo Finance, ThePrint)**: They highlight Brazil’s plan to capitalise on Trump’s steep tariffs by grabbing U.S. market share in China and sealing practical deals on commodities and infrastructure. By centering on export volumes and investment deals, these reports can downplay broader geopolitical tensions or social and environmental costs stressed by other sources.
