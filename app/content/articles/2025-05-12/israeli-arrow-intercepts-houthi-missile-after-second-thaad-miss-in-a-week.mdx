# Israeli Arrow Intercepts Houthi Missile After Second THAAD Miss in a Week

On 9 May 2025 a Houthi ballistic missile aimed at Ben Gurion Airport was shot down by Israel’s Arrow system while the U.S.–supplied THAAD battery missed its target for the second time in five days.

#### Focusing Facts

- Sirens sounded at 16:25 local time across central Israel as the Arrow interceptor destroyed the projectile; airport operations paused for roughly one hour.

- The earlier THAAD miss occurred on 4 May, when an Arrow malfunction let a Houthi missile hit Ben Gurion, injuring six and prompting Israeli strikes that wrecked Sanaa International Airport and other Yemeni infrastructure.

- Oman-mediated cease-fire announced 7 May between Washington and the Houthis covers Red Sea shipping but explicitly excludes attacks on Israel.

#### Context

Ballistic–missile duels in the Middle East echo the 1991 Gulf War, when Patriot batteries similarly struggled to stop Iraqi Scuds despite early claims of near-perfect success.  Today’s back-to-back THAAD failures underscore a recurring lesson: even the most advanced interceptors offer probabilistic, not airtight, defense—especially against adversaries willing to absorb losses to probe weaknesses, as Iran-aligned Houthis have since first striking Red Sea traffic in late 2023.  Strategically, the episode reveals two converging trends: (1) the diffusion of long-range precision weapons to non-state actors, eroding the monopoly once held by major powers; and (2) Israel’s increasing need to rely on its indigenous systems rather than U.S. umbrellas, hinting at a gradual decoupling of operational responsibility despite political alignment.  Over a 100-year horizon, this moment will matter less for the single missile than for what it signals: the normalization of proxy forces wielding theater-range missiles that can reach beyond immediate battlefields, challenging both the credibility of great-power security guarantees and the notion that maritime or air corridors can be kept safe by technology alone.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli national media (e.g., The Times of Israel, Jewish News Syndicate)**: Report that Israel’s Arrow system downed the Houthi missile and stress officials’ pledges of a forceful retaliatory strike against the Iran-backed group. Coverage spotlights Israeli technological success and deterrence rhetoric while skimming over civilian cost in Yemen or Gaza and soft-pedalling the U.S. THAAD failures highlighted only in passing.

- **Pro-Palestinian or ‘Axis of Resistance’ outlets (e.g., Palestine Info Center, Mehr News Agency)**: Portray the hypersonic missile as penetrating Israeli defenses, disrupting Ben Gurion Airport and proving effective retaliation for Israel’s ‘war crimes’ in Gaza. Accounts amplify Houthi success, sometimes contradicting Israeli interception claims, and frame the strike as justified resistance while omitting Houthi attacks on commercial shipping or Iranian backing.

- **U.S. right-leaning alternative media (e.g., Zero Hedge)**: Emphasises that America’s THAAD system missed interception for the second time, depicting an embarrassing failure amid Trump’s declared Red Sea cease-fire. Storyline fixates on U.S. military shortcomings and Washington’s role, using a skeptical, anti-establishment tone that may overstate the broader strategic impact and neglect humanitarian aspects of the conflict.
