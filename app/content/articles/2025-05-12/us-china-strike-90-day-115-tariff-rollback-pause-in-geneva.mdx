# US-China Strike 90-Day 115 % Tariff Rollback Pause in Geneva

On 12 May 2025, Beijing and Washington agreed to suspend their tariff war for 90 days and each cut the punitive levies they had just imposed by 115 percent while broader negotiations continue.

#### Focusing Facts

- Deal trims U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 % to 30 % and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods from 125 % to 10 % starting 14 May 2025.

- Agreement includes a new bilateral “trade consultation mechanism” and an expiry date of 11 Aug 2025 unless extended.

- Talks were held 10-12 May 2025 in Geneva between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent & USTR Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng.

#### Context

Short truces after tariff spirals have precedent: the June 1931 Hoover Moratorium paused WWI debt tariffs for a year but failed to arrest the slide into protectionism. Likewise, the 2018 G20 handshake between Trump and Xi promised a 90-day cease-fire that evaporated in weeks. Today’s pause reflects the longer trend of managed decoupling—U.S. strategic tariffs, China’s “dual circulation,” and global supply-chain nationalism—rather than a return to the hyper-integration of 2001-2021. On a century timeline, the decision may be a mere braking maneuver in the unwinding of the ‘Chimerica’ trade super-cycle; its lasting significance will depend on whether the 90-day window leads to structural accords or simply postpones an already-in-motion economic bifurcation.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left-leaning Western media (e.g., The Guardian, The New York Times, Washington Post)**: Stress that the 90-day tariff pause is only a temporary de-escalation and does little to fix the structural rift between Washington and Beijing, warning that a real trade deal is still far away. By foregrounding caveats and expert scepticism, these outlets undercut the Trump administration’s narrative of success, reflecting a long-standing editorial stance that is wary of Trump’s economic policies and keen to highlight their shortcomings.

- **Right-leaning, pro-Trump outlets (e.g., The Last Refuge, Real Clear Politics)**: Celebrate the talks as a major victory for President Trump’s hard-nosed tariff strategy, portraying Beijing as suddenly eager to ‘play ball’ and hailing a swift, cooperative “deal.” These sources have an incentive to frame any progress as proof that tough tariffs work, so they amplify triumphalist White House rhetoric while glossing over the limited, time-bound nature of the agreement and the economic pain that led to it.

- **International wire services & financial press (e.g., Reuters, Economic Times)**: Report the bare facts that U.S. and Chinese negotiators began talks and agreed to slash reciprocal tariffs by 115 % for 90 days, noting immediate market relief but withholding judgement on long-term outcomes. Focused on speed and market impact for a global investor audience, these outlets may under-explore political motivations or human-interest angles, implicitly treating the dispute chiefly as a numbers-driven market event.
