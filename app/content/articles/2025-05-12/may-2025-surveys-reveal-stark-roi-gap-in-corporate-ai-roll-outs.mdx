# May 2025 Surveys Reveal Stark ROI Gap in Corporate AI Roll-Outs

Three newly released surveys of executives and developers show that, despite near-universal experimentation, fewer than one in four companies worldwide have achieved enterprise-wide deployment or meaningful returns on their AI investments.

#### Focusing Facts

- IBM poll of 2,000 global CEOs: only 25 % report expected ROI and just 16 % say AI is scaled company-wide.

- BCG X survey of 1,800 C-suite leaders in 20 countries: 75 % list AI among top-three priorities, yet only 25 % see “significant value.”

- GitHub study of 2,000 developers across four nations: 97 % have used AI coding tools, but only 30-40 % say their firms actively promote adoption.

#### Context

This disconnect echoes the late-1980s expert-systems bust, when companies like Digital Equipment poured money into rule-based “AI” only to shelve most projects by 1992 after failing to scale them.  Today’s struggle is less about algorithms—cheap, abundant—and more about organizational plumbing: data quality, workflows, power-hungry GPUs and the rewiring of jobs.  On a 100-year arc, the pattern tracks other General Purpose Technologies such as electricity (diffusion 1880-1940) and the internet (1970-2010): initial hype, disappointing productivity, then gradual, transformative uptake once costs fall and complementary processes mature.  The 2025 surveys matter because they signal that AI’s bottleneck has shifted from model capability to economic viability; whichever firms—and nations—solve cost, infrastructure and change-management first will set the competitive baseline for decades, while hardware vendors reliant on ever-larger models may face a deflationary squeeze similar to mainframe makers after the PC wave.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Investor-oriented financial media**: Recent CEO and C-suite surveys show AI projects rarely reach enterprise scale or deliver expected ROI, signalling that high-priced GPU demand may falter and companies should focus on a few core, cost-effective use cases. Pieces aimed at investors and consulting clients profit from spotlighting risk, so they foreground negative survey stats and downplay success stories to position themselves as prudent guides in a cooling AI market.

- **Tech-industry and corporate blogs**: AI adoption is accelerating across software teams and the wider economy, boosting productivity and national competitiveness, provided the U.S. rapidly expands specialised cloud, power and workforce infrastructure. Authored by firms that sell AI tooling or infrastructure, the coverage naturally accentuates upside and urges supportive policies, framing their own commercial expansion as a national imperative.

- **Mainstream public-interest media**: While AI is spreading, it is still unreliable and prone to sycophancy, will not replace most workers soon, and must be integrated cautiously in schools and society to curb misinformation and cheating. These outlets cater to a general audience wary of disruption, so they emphasise safeguards and sensational pitfalls—like chatbots encouraging delusions—which may underplay genuine efficiency gains and reinforce anxiety.
