# Geneva Weekend Accord Sets Stage to Slash Trump’s 145% China Tariffs Toward 80%

After two days of closed-door talks in Geneva on 10–11 May 2025, U.S. and Chinese negotiators announced “substantial progress,” promising details Monday and hinting at cutting U.S. duties—pegged at 145% since February—to roughly 80%.

#### Focusing Facts

- Negotiations involved Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, USTR Jamieson Greer, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng for over 10 hours across 10-11 May 2025 in Geneva.

- On 9 May 2025 President Trump publicly floated an 80% tariff ceiling on Chinese imports, down from the current 145%, saying the final rate was “up to Scott B.”

- U.S.–China annual goods trade, once about $600 billion, has shrunk to a virtual standstill under reciprocal tariffs of 145% and 125%, according to USA Today.

#### Context

Great-power tariff bargains are rare but not unprecedented: the 1934 U.S.-Canada Reciprocal Trade Agreement (after Smoot-Hawley’s 59% average duties) similarly signaled a climb-down from self-inflicted protectionist pain.  This Geneva mini-deal sits at the intersection of two long arcs: first, the post-1990 hyper-integration of U.S.-China supply chains, and second, their 2018-present strategic unwinding as both capitals weaponize trade.  Xi’s 2020 directive to “tighten production-chain dependence on our country” and Trump’s 2025 ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs are mirror images of a broader shift from rules-based liberalization toward coercive geo-economics.  Whether the rate drops to 80% or 8% matters less on a century scale than the precedent: both sides now treat tariffs not as anomalies but as normal bargaining chips, echoing the mercantile rivalries of the late 19th-century Great Powers.  If sustained, today’s tentative thaw may resemble the 1985 Plaza Accord—temporary relief that masked a deeper structural rivalry—rather than a return to the 2001–2016 free-trade status quo.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning US media (Fox News, New York Post)**: Cast the Geneva negotiations as a significant Trump win, echoing his "total reset" language and stressing that Beijing is yielding under heavy tariffs. Close ideological affinity with the Trump administration drives upbeat framing while glossing over the lack of concrete terms or possible consumer costs, as the stories rely heavily on quotes from Trump officials without independent verification.

- **Left-leaning media outlets (The Guardian, The New York Times)**: Emphasise that meaningful concessions are unconfirmed, warning the tariff war still imperils the global economy and depicting the talks as part of a broader, high-stakes power struggle between Trump and Xi. Long-standing scepticism of Trump’s trade nationalism colours coverage that spotlights risks and uncertainties, potentially downplaying any tangible gains and framing the talks through a narrative of U.S. mismanagement and Chinese resilience.

- **International wire & mainstream outlets (Reuters, USA Today, BBC)**: Report that officials cite “substantial progress” while noting details remain vague, conveying cautious optimism but stressing the negotiations are ongoing. Commitment to straight news may lead to heavy reliance on official briefings and ‘he-said, she-said’ language, which can understate underlying power imbalances or broader economic impacts.
