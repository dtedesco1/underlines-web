# Microsoft Hires Ex-Meta Marketer and Hard-Wires “Ask Copilot” Into Windows 11

Between May 10–12 2025 Microsoft both recruited former Meta creative chief Mark D’Arcy to re-brand Copilot and rolled out update 1.25044.93.0 that forces an “Ask Copilot” item into Windows 11’s right-click menu, signaling an aggressive pivot to lift the AI assistant’s stalled adoption.

#### Focusing Facts

- D’Arcy began reporting to Microsoft AI head Mustafa Suleyman on 10 May 2025 to lead consumer marketing for Copilot.

- Windows 11 build 1.25044.93.0 added an un-removable (without registry hack) context-menu entry titled “Ask Copilot”.

- Similarweb data cited by The Information shows Copilot holding less than 5 % share versus ChatGPT’s greater than 80 % as of May 2025.

#### Context

Big tech has tried this playbook before: in 1998 Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer into Windows to outflank Netscape; forty years earlier (1955) RCA inserted its new color-TV standard into every broadcast it owned to force adoption. Embedding Copilot at the shell level and hiring a Madison Avenue veteran echoes those tactics—leveraging distribution power and narrative control to overcome a late start in a winner-takes-most network market. Long-term, the move reflects a system trend toward operating systems becoming AI-first platforms where the UI itself negotiates with large-language models. Whether users embrace or resist this forced exposure will shape notions of agency and privacy in personal computing for decades; a century from now, historians may see 2025 as the moment everyday interfaces shifted from passive tools to proactive cognitive intermediaries.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Consumer tech lifestyle media (e.g., MakeUseOf, Tom's Guide)**: Frame Copilot as a feature-packed assistant that can sometimes outshine ChatGPT and meaningfully boost everyday productivity. How-to/enthusiast outlets profit from upbeat feature round-ups, so they highlight benefits and skip deeper critiques that might dampen reader excitement.

- **Windows power-user sites critical of bloat (e.g., XDA-Developers, BetaNews, Windows Latest)**: Cast Microsoft’s new context-menu and File Explorer hooks as an unwanted, heavy-handed push to force Copilot on users whose enthusiasm has plateaued. Amplifying backlash against ‘forced’ features aligns with an audience that values control and drives traffic through controversy, which can lead to overstating the scale of discontent.

- **Business/market strategy outlets (e.g., Android Central, The Hindu)**: Portray the hiring of ex-Meta marketer Mark D’Arcy as Microsoft’s strategic bid to give Copilot a relatable voice and close a gaping market-share gap with ChatGPT. By focusing on executive moves and market share, they can gloss over technical or user-experience flaws, echoing corporate narratives about branding as the primary hurdle.
