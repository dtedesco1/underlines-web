# China's Manufacturing PMI Reversal Amid New Tariff Threats

Early February forecasts signaled a second month of contraction with a PMI of 49.9, but by March an official reading of 50.2 indicated a rebound amid aggressive stimulus measures.

#### Focusing Facts

- Reuters poll of 21 economists forecast a February PMI of 49.9, below the growth threshold.

- An official survey on March 1 showed a PMI of 50.2, a three-month high signaling expansion.

- U.S. President Trump announced an extra 10% tariff effective March 4, bringing cumulative duties to 20%.

#### Context

This mixed signal reflects recurring economic volatility under external pressures. Like during the 2008 global financial crisis when massive stimulus turned a contracting economy into a growth engine, Beijing’s recent measures illustrate a tactical response to external tariff hikes and sluggish domestic demand. The immediate reversal from contraction to expansion underscores the impact of aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, yet it also reveals the delicate balance China faces amid a shifting global trade environment—a pattern that resonates with historical economic interventions and may only have transient long-term effects on the structural evolution of the world economy.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Market Caution Media**: Their reports emphasize that China's manufacturing activity contracted for a second month, highlighting weak domestic demand and the pressure from U.S. tariffs, with experts calling for further stimulus measures. This approach leverages Reuters poll data and focuses on external trade tensions, potentially underemphasizing any signs of recovery or positive trends. ([Yahoo!

- **Stimulus Optimism Media**: They highlight evidence of a rebound in China's manufacturing activity as Beijing’s stimulus measures appear to bring the economy back into expansion, with a three-month high PMI in February. This perspective may overstate the effectiveness of short-term stimulus and downplay ongoing structural and external challenges such as persistent U.S. tariffs.
