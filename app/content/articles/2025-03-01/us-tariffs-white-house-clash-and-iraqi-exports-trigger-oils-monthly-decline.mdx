# US Tariffs, White House Clash, and Iraqi Exports Trigger Oil’s Monthly Decline

On February 28, 2025, a mix of imminent US tariffs, a public spat between President Trump and President Zelenskiy, and Iraq’s plan to restart Kurdish exports pushed oil prices into their first monthly drop since November 2024.

#### Focusing Facts

- Brent crude settled near $73.18 per barrel and WTI at about $69.76 on February 28, 2025.

- US tariffs of 25% on Mexican and Canadian goods and an extra 10% on Chinese imports are set to take effect on March 4, 2025.

- Iraq announced a resumption of 185,000 bpd oil exports via the Kurdistan region, raising questions over its OPEC+ quota compliance.

#### Context

This episode echoes past market tremors such as the October 2024 price stabilization amid Iran–Israel tensions and, more historically, the 1973 oil embargo which reshaped global energy strategies. It reflects a long-term trend where geopolitical maneuvers, from sanctions to trade tariffs, regularly interact with market fundamentals, often yielding short-term price adjustments. Though dramatic, these incidents are part of a pattern of periodic volatility in an increasingly interconnected global energy system—a dynamic that over the next century will continue to challenge regulators and market participants alike in balancing national interests with global supply-demand realities.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream Financial Media (Reuters)**: They emphasize that oil price movements are largely driven by market fundamentals like supply-demand balances and analyst forecasts, suggesting that ample supply and the possibility of a peace deal could moderate prices. This group may underplay the nuances of political drama and focus predominantly on quantitative data, potentially overlooking the broader geopolitical consequences.

- **Political Narrative Focused Media (ThePrint and Business Times)**: They frame the situation as being heavily influenced by political conflicts such as the White House spat and tariff escalations, highlighting how these heated exchanges could significantly impact oil markets. Their interpretation can be seen as amplifying political drama to explain market volatility, potentially exaggerating the direct impact of political disputes on oil supply and prices.

- **Commodity & Trade Specialist Outlets (OilPrice.com)**: They focus on the technical and trade aspects, arguing that tariff risks and uncertainties over sanctions weigh more heavily on oil prices than other factors, thereby influencing market sentiment. This analysis, while detailed, might overemphasize short-term market reactions and trade policy risks, aligning with a more speculative approach to price movements.
