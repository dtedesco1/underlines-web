# OpenAI Rolls Out GPT-4.5 'Orion' Amid Shifts in AI Scaling and GPU Shortages

On February 27, 2025, OpenAI launched GPT-4.5—codenamed Orion—a research preview that offers enhanced writing, coding, and conversational abilities for ChatGPT Pro subscribers while marking the last non-chain-of-thought model release.

#### Focusing Facts

- Launched on February 27, 2025, exclusively for $200/month ChatGPT Pro users as a research preview.

- GPT-4.5 boasts improved nuance, higher emotional intelligence, and fewer hallucinations but is not intended as a reasoning model.

- A severe GPU shortage necessitated a staggered rollout with tens of thousands of additional GPUs planned before broader access.

#### Context

GPT-4.5’s rollout reflects a broader trend in AI where rapid scaling and pre-training methods—similar to the leap from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 in early 2023—continue to push capabilities while revealing new challenges. Historically, technology shifts such as the introduction of high-performance computing clusters in the early 2000s reshaped industries by forcing infrastructure upgrades; similarly, OpenAI’s need to source tens of thousands more GPUs underscores the escalating hardware demands of modern AI. This moment is significant on a century-long scale as it encapsulates both the relentless drive toward more advanced, human-like interactions and the inevitable tensions between innovation and available computing resources, setting the stage for future models that might finally combine pre-training with sophisticated reasoning.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Tech-Centric Analysts**: They focus on the technical specs, compute intensity, and the challenges of scaling up GPT-4.5, noting that its heavy computational demands and cost issues may limit its broader impact. This group may emphasize the engineering hurdles and cost concerns to question the viability of such large models, potentially downplaying consumer benefits in favor of a technical critique.

- **Chat Experience Advocates**: They highlight GPT-4.5's improved natural conversation, emotional intelligence, and user-friendly interactions, suggesting it makes chatting more intuitive and supportive. This perspective might understate the model’s technical limitations and cost issues, focusing instead on consumer appeal and the anecdotal quality of interactions.

- **Ethical and Persuasion Critics**: They draw attention to peculiar internal benchmarks such as the model's ability to persuade other AIs, raising concerns over social engineering and manipulation risks. This view can be seen as sensational, possibly overstating risks and ethical concerns to cast doubt on the technology’s broader societal impact.
