# Blue Origin’s Historic NS-31: First All-Woman Crew Launches This Spring

Blue Origin announced its NS-31 mission on February 27, 2025, featuring an all-female crew including Katy Perry, Gayle King, and Lauren Sánchez, set to launch this spring.

#### Focusing Facts

- NS-31 is the 11th human flight of the New Shepard program, which has flown 52 people past the Kármán line.

- This mission marks the first all-woman spaceflight since Valentina Tereshkova’s solo trip in 1963.

- The six-member crew also includes aerospace professionals Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.

#### Context

The NS-31 mission is comparable to historic milestones like Tereshkova’s 1963 solo flight aboard Vostok 6, yet it reflects modern advances in commercial space travel and broader societal participation. While Tereshkova’s journey was a product of cold-war era geopolitics and state-controlled programs, today’s mission underscores a long-term trend toward democratizing space access and highlighting diversity in exploration. In the context of a century’s evolution, this flight is both a symbolic moment for female representation and a marker of how private companies have reshaped the space industry, moving beyond government monopolies to potentially redefine humanity’s spacefaring future.
