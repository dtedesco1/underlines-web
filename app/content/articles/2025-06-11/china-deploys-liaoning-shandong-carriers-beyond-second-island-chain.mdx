# China Deploys Liaoning & Shandong Carriers Beyond Second Island Chain

Between 8–10 June 2025, the Liaoning and Shandong carrier groups crossed Japan’s outer defensive line and ran simultaneous flight-deck drills inside Japan’s EEZ—Beijing’s first dual-carrier operation that far into the Pacific.

#### Focusing Facts

- Japan tracked Liaoning 300 km southwest of Minamitorishima and Shandong inside waters around Okinotori Atoll, both within Japan’s EEZ, during 8–10 June 2025.

- Tokyo’s Defense Ministry stated this is the first recorded occasion two Chinese aircraft carriers operated concurrently east of Japan and beyond the Second Island Chain.

- The Liaoning task force grew to eight ships, including two Type 055 destroyers, two Type 052D destroyers, a Type 054A frigate and two replenishment ships.

#### Context

Great-power navies have long signalled rising ambition by pushing carrier groups past perceived containment lines—much as Imperial Japan’s Kido Butai steamed 3,900 km to strike Pearl Harbor in December 1941 or the Soviet Navy showcased blue-water reach during its 1970 ‘Okean-70’ global exercise.  China’s foray reflects a 30-year trend that began with Deng Xiaoping’s 1985 directive to build a “strong ocean fleet” and accelerated after 2008 anti-piracy deployments; each carrier voyage tests logistics, escorts and crew coordination needed for sustained blue-water presence.  Strategically, it chips away at the U.S.–Japan concept of layered island chains that has framed Western Pacific defense since the 1950s and foreshadows a future in which multiple Asian navies, not just the U.S., field carrier strike groups.  On a century arc, this moment could mark the transition from a unipolar maritime order to a multipolar one—less dramatic than Pearl Harbor but potentially as consequential for the balance of naval power in the Pacific by 2050 if China converts episodic demonstrations into routine patrols.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **U.S. and Japanese mainstream national-security newspapers (e.g., The New York Times, Newsweek)**: They frame the twin-carrier deployment as clear evidence that Beijing can now breach the ‘first’ and even ‘second’ island chains, posing a new strategic challenge to Japan, Guam and ultimately the U.S. Navy. Because their stories lean heavily on Japanese Defence Ministry briefings and U.S. security experts, they may accentuate the threat to validate existing containment strategies and justify higher regional military spending.

- **Right-leaning, hawkish outlets (e.g., Breitbart, UK’s Express)**: They portray the Liaoning’s passage inside Japan’s EEZ as an alarming ‘incursion’ that shows China’s growing aggression and the inadequacy of current Western deterrence. Using dramatic wording such as “unwanted visitor” and highlighting Japan’s ‘uncomfortable’ reaction, these outlets amplify fear and nationalist sentiment, pushing for tougher military postures toward Beijing. ([Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2025/06/10/chinese-aircraft-carrier-enters-japans-eastern-waters-for-first-time/), [EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2066651/china-japan-eez))

- **Anti-interventionist/alternative finance media (e.g., Zero Hedge)**: They dismiss the uproar as Western ‘hyperventilating’, noting that China’s mere two carriers pale next to America’s eleven and that exercising near its own backyard is logically defensive. By focusing on U.S. hypocrisy and NATO’s Pacific forays while skimming over neighbors’ legal concerns, this perspective risks downplaying legitimate regional security anxieties to advance an anti-establishment, anti-NATO narrative.
