# London Round of US-China Talks Links Chip Curbs to Rare-Earth Licenses

On 9–10 Jun 2025, negotiators in London opened a second post-Geneva meeting where Washington offered to relax some semiconductor export controls if Beijing resumed large-volume rare-earth shipments frozen since April.

#### Focusing Facts

- Tariffs that spiked to a 145 % floor in April were cut back to 30 % (US on China) and 10 % (China on US) under the 90-day Geneva truce signed 12 May 2025.

- China, which processes about 90 % of global rare-earths, imposed a shipment-by-shipment licensing system on seven elements and related magnets starting 1 Apr 2025.

- Ford idled its Chicago Explorer SUV plant on 27 May 2025 because samarium-cobalt magnets from China failed to arrive.

#### Context

The standoff rhymes with the 1973 Arab oil embargo and Beijing’s own 2010 halt of rare-earth exports to Japan—moments when a supplier weaponised a niche resource only to spur diversification and substitution drives elsewhere.  Today’s dance exposes a structural shift: the world’s largest miner of critical minerals depends on foreign lithography and chip design, while the top semiconductor innovator lacks key inputs buried under Chinese soil.  For five decades globalisation masked these mutual choke-points; the London talks show they are now negotiating chips on the table, literally and figuratively.  Whether the handshake materialises matters less than the signal that supply chains are being rewired—decisions that, like OPEC’s birth in 1960 or the 1986 US-Japan semiconductor accord, echo for generations.  On a 100-year arc this episode may mark the moment when resource security and technology security formally merged, accelerating a slow but relentless slide from liberalised trade toward bloc-based resiliency planning.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left-leaning U.S. media (e.g., The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN)**: They contend that China’s control of rare earth exports shows Trump’s tariff strategy backfiring and giving Beijing meaningful leverage in the standoff. Coverage stresses White House missteps and may play down China’s own economic vulnerabilities to underscore criticism of Trump. ([The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/10/us/trump-news), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/10/china-leverage-us-trade-war/))

- **Right-leaning U.S. media (e.g., Fox News, Fox Business)**: They depict Trump as shrewdly pressing Beijing toward a quick handshake that will restart rare-earth shipments and prove U.S. strength. Reporting echoes administration talking points, tends to highlight Trump’s assertiveness while under-reporting tariff costs to U.S. firms and consumers.

- **International financial press (e.g., Financial Times, BBC)**: They frame the London negotiations as a pragmatic, market-moving bid to calm investors and secure a trade compromise hinging on rare-earth supplies. Market-centric focus prioritizes investor sentiment and may gloss over broader geopolitical and labor implications of the dispute.
