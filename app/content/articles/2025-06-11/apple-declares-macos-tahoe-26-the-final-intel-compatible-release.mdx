# Apple Declares macOS Tahoe 26 the Final Intel-Compatible Release

At WWDC 2025 Apple disclosed that macOS 26 “Tahoe,” due this fall, will be the last version of macOS installable on Intel-based Macs; macOS 27 in 2026 and beyond will require Apple Silicon hardware.

#### Focusing Facts

- Only four Intel machines—2019 16-inch MacBook Pro, 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro (4× TB3), 2020 iMac, and 2019 Mac Pro—remain on Tahoe’s support list.

- Apple says it will supply security-only patches for Tahoe until late 2028, aligning with its typical three-year post-release window.

- Rosetta 2’s broad Intel-to-Arm translation will be curtailed after macOS 27, limited mainly to aging games lacking active developers.

#### Context

Apple’s third processor migration (68k→PowerPC in 1994, PowerPC→Intel in 2006, now Intel→Apple Silicon) underscores a 30-year pattern: every ~15 years the Mac platform abandons a chip family to chase performance-per-watt and tighter hardware–software control. Like 2006, the outgoing architecture is promised security patches for ~3 years, effectively nudging customers to buy new hardware sooner—a strategy as much about supply-chain leverage and services lock-in as technical merit. Intel’s post-2015 manufacturing delays and CEO shake-up (Gelsinger ousted 2024) weakened its bargaining power, while Arm-based SoCs delivered mobile-style efficiencies the data-center world has prized since Google’s 2009 “performance per watt” papers. Over a century-scale lens, this moment is another waypoint in the steady consolidation of computing stacks: proprietary silicon married to vertically integrated ecosystems, reducing heterogeneity but increasing vendor lock-in and e-waste turnover. Whether that trade-off favors innovation or entrenches walled gardens will define the Mac’s relevance when the next architecture sunset comes due in the 2040s.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Apple-focused enthusiast tech media (e.g., MacRumors, TechSpot)**: Hail macOS Tahoe’s Liquid Glass redesign, AI-powered features, and deeper iPhone integration as an exciting leap that will enhance productivity for Mac users. Depend on an Apple-centric audience and early-access newsroom relationships, so they highlight flashy upgrades while largely downplaying the cost and disruption for owners of soon-unsupported Intel Macs.

- **Business and financial press (e.g., Bloomberg Business)**: Frames the announcement chiefly as the formal end of Apple’s two-decade reliance on Intel chips, underscoring the strategic and economic implications of Apple Silicon’s ascendancy. Investor-focused angle spotlights corporate winners and losers, giving scant attention to everyday users’ upgrade dilemmas or the technical nuances of the transition.

- **Critical IT industry news sites (e.g., The Register, Ars Technica)**: Portray Apple’s phase-out of Intel Macs and future limits on Rosetta as a mixed bag—inevitable yet abrupt—stressing shortened support timelines and the practical headaches for developers and legacy hardware owners. Adopts a skeptical tone that attracts a technically savvy readership, so it emphasizes drawbacks and second-guesses Apple’s timetable, at times overlooking the benefits touted elsewhere.
