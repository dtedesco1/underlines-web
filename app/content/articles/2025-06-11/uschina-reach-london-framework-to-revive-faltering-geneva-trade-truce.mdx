# US–China Reach London Framework to Revive Faltering Geneva Trade Truce

On 11 June 2025, after two days of negotiations in London, American and Chinese envoys produced a draft framework that, pending Trump and Xi’s signatures, would restart Chinese rare-earth exports and roll back the tit-for-tat export and tariff barriers that had resurfaced since their May accord in Geneva.

#### Focusing Facts

- Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Vice-Commerce Minister Li Chenggang unveiled the deal at Lancaster House following roughly 20 hours of talks on 10–11 June 2025.

- Under the draft, China pledges immediate resumption of rare-earth and magnet shipments; the U.S. in turn would ease recent semiconductor, aerospace and energy export controls.

- In a Truth Social post, President Trump boasted the final package would leave U.S. tariffs at 55% versus China’s 10%, a claim not corroborated by negotiators’ public remarks.

#### Context

Great-power trade truces are notoriously fragile: the 1931 Hoover Moratorium temporarily eased WWI debt tensions yet collapsed within a year; similarly the 2019 U.S.–China “Phase One” deal evaporated under pandemic strain. Today’s framework fits a century-long pattern in which economic weapons—tariffs in the 1930s, OPEC oil embargoes in 1973, China’s 2010 rare-earth halt against Japan—are brandished until mutual pain forces a pause. The London venue, echoing the 1946 Anglo-American loan talks, signals reliance on neutral ground when bilateral trust is low. Structurally, the episode underscores two trends: (1) strategic minerals and advanced chips have replaced soybeans and textiles as leverage in 21st-century mercantilism; (2) the post-Cold-War assumption of frictionless globalization is giving way to managed interdependence, where flows restart only under politically negotiated quotas. Whether this moment matters in 2125 depends on if it marks the start of durable supply-chain détente or just another stop-gap before the next escalation in a slow, possibly irreversible, economic decoupling.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media (e.g., CNBC segments amplifying Trump’s statements, Investing.com market commentary)**: Portrays the London talks as a decisive Trump victory, claiming the trade deal is already “done” and guarantees upfront Chinese rare-earth supplies while the U.S. retains steep 55% tariffs on Chinese goods. Echoes Trump’s triumphalist framing and tariff bravado, glossing over the fact the pact still needs both presidents’ approval and ignoring possible economic fallout for U.S. consumers and firms.

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The New York Times, The Guardian)**: Acknowledges a tentative framework but stresses how earlier accords unraveled, underscoring lingering mistrust, tariff escalation and the fragility of any truce between the two powers. Highlights discord and prior failures to cast Trump’s trade strategy as erratic, downplaying officials’ optimism and potential near-term easing of tensions.

- **Financial/market-focused outlets (e.g., Bloomberg via Yahoo Finance, CNBC’s straight market coverage)**: Frames the framework as a welcome de-escalation that should unblock rare-earth shipments, lift some export controls and calm markets after weeks of uncertainty. Tries to reassure investors and spot trading opportunities, so it accentuates progress and glosses over structural geopolitical rifts or labor/rights concerns that don’t directly move markets.
