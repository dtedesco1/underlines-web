# EU’s 18th Russia Sanctions Package Slashes Oil Cap to $45 and Outlaws Nord Stream Dealings

On 10 June 2025 Brussels unveiled a draft 18th sanctions tranche that would drop the G7 price ceiling on Russian crude from $60 to $45 per barrel and forbid any EU transaction involving the dormant Nord Stream 1 & 2 pipelines.

#### Focusing Facts

- The proposal blacklists an extra 77 tankers, raising the EU-listed “shadow fleet” from 342 to 419 vessels.

- It converts the SWIFT exclusion into a blanket transaction ban for 22 more Russian banks and extends the ban to third-country institutions financing sanctioned trade.

- €2.5 billion worth of new export bans would hit machinery, metals, plastics, chemicals and dual-use tech critical to drones and missiles.

#### Context

Large-scale economic coercion has precedents—from the 1935 League of Nations oil embargo on Fascist Italy to Washington’s 2012 cut-off of Iranian banks from SWIFT—but the EU’s eighteenth round marks the deepest energy decoupling ever attempted between two contiguous great-power economies.  It reflects a 30-year arc in which finance, rather than armies, has become the West’s quickest force multiplier: successive packages have already shrunk Russia’s monthly EU energy revenue from €12 billion in 2021 to €1.8 billion.  By targeting unused Nord Stream pipes, Brussels signals that post-Cold-War dependence on Russian hydrocarbons—built after the 1982 “Siberian pipeline” sanctions fight—is now politically irreversible, reshaping Europe’s energy grid for decades.  Whether sanctions hasten peace or merely accelerate Russia’s pivot to Asia will colour great-power alignments well into the late-21st-century era of fragmented trade blocs and weaponised supply chains.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western mainstream media (e.g., CNN, The New York Times, POLITICO)**: Present the EU’s 18th sanctions package as a firm, necessary escalation to force Moscow toward a genuine cease-fire, stressing that “strength is the only language Russia understands.” By foregrounding EU officials’ talking points and successes, these outlets may gloss over the bloc’s internal rifts and the sanctions’ economic blow-back, mirroring a broadly pro-EU, pro-Ukraine framing.

- **Russian state-owned media (e.g., RT)**: Frames the proposed sanctions as another illegitimate Western pressure tactic, noting prior pipeline sabotage and emphasizing that EU members like Hungary and Slovakia see the measures as self-defeating. Echoes Kremlin messaging that downplays damage to Russia and magnifies European dissent, seeking to delegitimize sanctions and deflect blame for the war. ([RT](https://www.rt.com/russia/618917-eu-nord-stream-sanctions/))

- **Business and financial press (e.g., Financial Times, Bloomberg Business)**: Zooms in on the economic mechanics—lowering the oil price cap to $45, banning Nord Stream transactions, and legal safeguards for EU assets—while flagging potential objections from Hungary and Slovakia. Commercial focus on market, investor and legal implications can underplay the humanitarian rationale or moral urgency, reflecting the audience’s economic interests over geopolitical ethics.
