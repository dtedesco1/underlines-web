# World Bank Cuts 2025 Global Growth Outlook to 2.3 % amid Trump Tariff Surge

On 10 June 2025 the World Bank shaved 0.4 percentage points off its 2025 global GDP forecast, lowering it to 2.3 %, and pinned the downgrade on the disruption caused by President Trump’s newly-imposed universal 10 % import tariff and related escalatory trade moves.

#### Focusing Facts

- The Bank reduced its U.S. growth projection for 2025 to 1.4 %, a 0.9-point drop from the January outlook.

- America’s effective average tariff rate has climbed from below 3 % to the mid-teens, the highest level since the 1930s.

- World merchandise trade is now expected to expand just 1.8 % in 2025 versus 3.4 % in 2024.

#### Context

Protectionist shocks have derailed global growth before: the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 triggered a two-thirds collapse in world trade within four years, while the oil-price jolts of the 1970s cut average global growth from 5 % in the 1960s to about 3 %. Today’s tariff spike is smaller in magnitude but strikes a world economy far more entwined through just-in-time supply chains. The Bank’s revision confirms a decade-long trend—every decade since the 2000s has grown more slowly and traded less, with trade growth sliding from 5.9 % in the 2000s to 2.6 % so far in the 2020s. Whether the current U.S. turn marks a temporary negotiating gambit or the institutional unwinding of the post-1945 liberal order will determine prosperity into the 22nd century: compounding a 0.4-point annual shortfall could erase roughly a trillion dollars of output by 2030, disproportionately hurting poorer states already battling debt and climate shocks.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left-leaning international media (e.g., The New York Times, Financial Times, BBC, ABC)**: Portray the World Bank downgrade as fresh evidence that President Trump’s tariff war is dragging the world into the weakest decade since the 1960s and hitting poor countries hardest. Framing stresses the damage as a near-inevitable result of Trump’s ‘lawless’ or ‘unpredictable’ governance, which can sharpen partisan criticism while downplaying other structural slow-growth factors the Bank itself cites. ([The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/business/trump-trade-war-global-economy.html), [Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/0356c68b-a0e9-44fb-b3f7-b84833bb167c))

- **Right-leaning U.S. media supportive of Trump (e.g., New York Post, some Washington Post coverage)**: Highlight that the World Bank ‘agrees’ with Trump’s complaint about foreign nations’ higher tariffs and urge those countries—not the U.S.—to act first by slashing their duties. By spotlighting a single briefing line, the coverage reframes the Bank’s wider warning about U.S.-led trade uncertainty into a vindication narrative, downplaying the report’s data on slowing U.S. growth and global damage from the tariff hikes. ([New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/06/10/us-news/world-bank-agrees-with-trumps-trade-complaints-urges-countries-to-lower-tariffs-on-us/), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/06/10/tariffs-world-bank-trump-trade-war/))

- **Market-focused financial wire services (e.g., Reuters, CNBC)**: Emphasise the concrete numbers—0.4-point cut to 2.3 % growth—and warn investors that escalating tariffs are a ‘significant headwind’ but could be reversed if negotiations halve duties. Lens is calibrated for investors, so it spotlights short-term market risk and potential upside scenarios, potentially under-playing political accountability or social fallout while foregrounding the prospects for a rebound that would reassure markets.
