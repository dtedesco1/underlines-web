# RBI Slashes Repo Rate by 25 bps Amid Fiscal and Growth Stimulus

On February 7, 2025, the RBI, under new Governor Sanjay Malhotra, cut its key policy rate from 6.5% to 6.25%—the first reduction in nearly five years—while the government’s Union Budget delivered tax relief aimed at boosting consumption.

#### Focusing Facts

- The repo rate was reduced by 25 basis points on February 7, 2025, lowering it from 6.5% to 6.25%.

- This move accompanies fiscal measures including an income tax cut and liquidity injections, with GDP growth forecasts adjusted to 6.4% for FY25 and 6.7% for FY26.

- Home loan EMIs are expected to drop by approximately 3.5% over a 20-year tenure, offering relief to borrowers.

#### Context

This policy shift, reminiscent of the 40 bps cut in May 2020 during the Covid crisis, marks a cautious pivot as the RBI balances supporting domestic growth with risks of rupee depreciation and tightening global financial conditions. While similar past measures—like post-2008 adjustments—provided temporary stimulus, today’s action reflects evolving challenges: subdued investment and consumption amid global trade uncertainties and tariff threats. Over a century, monetary policies have often oscillated between inflation control and growth support; this decision, though modest, underscores a long-term trend of incremental easing paired with fiscal prudence rather than revolutionary shifts.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business Optimists**: They see the RBI’s 25 bps repo rate cut as a welcome boost for consumption, private investment, and overall economic growth, especially in light of accompanying fiscal measures such as tax relief. This group may downplay the risks of inflation, currency depreciation, and potential delays in credit transmission to present a uniformly positive economic outlook.

- **Cautious Policy Analysts**: They acknowledge the necessity of the rate cut to stimulate the slowing economy but warn about lingering inflation risks, currency depreciation, and muted market reaction that may limit its effectiveness. This group tends to emphasize external risks and the potential negative side effects of monetary easing, reflecting concerns over global financial volatility and the limits of policy measures.
