# Moscow Talks: IAEA and Rosatom Tackle Nuclear Safety Amid Escalating Attacks

On February 7, 2025, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and Rosatom CEO Alexey Likhachev convened in Moscow to address nuclear safety at Zaporozhye amid rising Ukrainian military actions.

#### Focusing Facts

- IAEA inspector rotation at the Zaporozhye NPP is slated to resume in the coming days despite intensified security challenges.

- Rosatom reported a marked increase in Ukrainian attacks, including downed drones, missiles, and artillery strikes targeting Zaporozhye and Kursk plants.

- Rosatom announced plans to expand its role in international nuclear projects and safeguard the Ukrainian energy sector with Russian reactor technologies.

#### Context

The meeting is reminiscent of Cold War-era nuclear safety dialogues, such as the post-Chernobyl reforms of the late 20th century, when cross-border nuclear crises repeatedly underscored the need for robust international oversight. This 2025 encounter not only highlights acute operational challenges in a conflict zone but also reflects long-standing global trends in nuclear regulation and international cooperation, echoing systems established since the IAEAâ€™s formation in 1957. While the immediate tensions over Zaporozhye and growing regional risks call for urgent measures, the event fits within a broader historical continuum where safety, security, and technological cooperation in nuclear energy remain critical for global accountability and long-term stability.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Russian state media**: They depict the meeting between Rosatom and the IAEA as a frank, constructive dialogue that underscores Russia's commitment to ensuring nuclear safety, while emphasizing growing threats from Ukrainian attacks. They may be motivated to portray Russia's actions in a positive light and deflect criticism by framing Ukrainian actions as the root cause of nuclear safety challenges.

- **IAEA's official perspective as reported in media**: This group underscores the need for rigorous nuclear safety protocols and the importance of maintaining routine operations like inspector rotations, even amid heightened geopolitical tensions. They operate under significant international diplomatic pressures, which may lead them to downplay contentious issues or align with prevailing narratives to facilitate continued cooperation.
