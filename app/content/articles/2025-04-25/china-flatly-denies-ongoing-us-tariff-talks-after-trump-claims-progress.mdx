# China Flatly Denies Ongoing U.S. Tariff Talks After Trump Claims Progress

On 24 April 2025 Beijing publicly rejected Washington’s assertion that negotiations were in motion to pare back record-high tariffs, even as President Trump insisted that meetings had already taken place.

#### Focusing Facts

- U.S. import duties on Chinese goods sit at 145% following Trump’s 2 April "Liberation Day" order.

- China has counter-imposed 125% tariffs on U.S. products and conditions any talks on the prior removal of those duties.

- Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a closed-door investor summit on 22 April that he expects a “very near-term” de-escalation, an off-the-record remark that pushed the S&P 500 up 2.5%.

#### Context

Great-power tariff brinkmanship is hardly new; the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 triggered a 66% plunge in global trade within five years, while Nixon’s surprise 10% import surcharge in 1971 collapsed within four months under foreign retaliation. Today’s 145%-125% cross-fire eclipses those episodes, signalling a re-emergence of punitive mercantilism after three decades of post-WTO liberalisation. The clash also surfaces deeper structural currents: reshoring, techno-nationalism, and rising scepticism of multilateral institutions. Whether this moment becomes a new Bretton Woods (1944) or another Smoot-Hawley depends on credibility—now undermined by the two capitals giving mutually exclusive accounts of even holding a phone call. In a century-scale lens, the event matters because it tests whether the U.S.–China economic interdependence forged after 1978 can survive populist politics; a collapse would rewire supply chains for decades, much as the 1914 breakdown of Britain–Germany trade carved new commercial blocs for half a century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **U.S. business-oriented financial media (e.g., CNBC, Bloomberg Business)**: They report that senior officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expect the tariff standoff to de-escalate soon and that back-channel or lower-level talks are already happening between Washington and Beijing. By stressing optimistic signals that boost markets, these outlets cater to investor sentiment and may underplay how thin or unofficial the purported negotiations are.

- **Outlets highlighting Chinese official statements (e.g., BBC, The Hill, Yahoo! Finance)**: They relay Beijing’s categorical denial that any tariff talks are under way and amplify China’s demand that the U.S. lift all duties before serious negotiations can begin. Prioritising the Chinese ministry’s briefings paints Trump’s comments as baseless and risks overlooking any informal or undisclosed U.S. outreach that does not fit Beijing’s narrative.

- **Left-leaning political commentary outlets (e.g., The Guardian, The Daily Beast)**: They frame Trump’s sudden softening on tariffs as a panicked response to pressure from CEOs and market turmoil, portraying the administration as erratic and economically dangerous. By casting events through a lens of presidential fear and incompetence, coverage may exaggerate personal motives while giving limited attention to strategic or geopolitical factors cited by officials.
