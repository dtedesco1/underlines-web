# India Puts Indus Waters Treaty on Ice, Slashes Diplomatic Links; Pakistan Responds in Kind

On 23 Apr 2025 New Delhi suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, shut the Attari–Wagah border, and ordered large-scale expulsions of Pakistani diplomats after the Pahalgam tourist massacre, triggering reciprocal expulsions, trade and air‐space bans from Islamabad within 24 hours.

#### Focusing Facts

- India’s Cabinet Committee on Security voted on 23 Apr 2025 to hold the Indus Waters Treaty ‘in abeyance’, the first formal suspension of the pact that had survived the 1965, 1971 and 1999 wars.

- Pakistan’s defence, naval and air advisers in Delhi were declared persona non grata and told to leave within seven days; overall mission staff on each side is to be cut from 55 to 30 by 1 May 2025.

- On 24 Apr 2025 Islamabad expelled at least three Indian defence advisers, halted all India trade and closed its airspace to Indian-owned aircraft.

#### Context

Weaponising water throws the sub-continent back to the 1948 canal disputes that preceded the Indus pact, echoing how Egypt and Sudan clashed over Nile projects in the 1950s.  India’s move fits a post-2016 pattern of calibrated retaliation—surgical strikes (2016) and Balakot air raid (2019)—but crosses a line by targeting a resource regime explicitly insulated from conflict for 65 years.  It also mirrors a broader global trend where upstream states—from Ethiopia on the Blue Nile to China on the Mekong—use dams and data to gain leverage as climate stress tightens.  Over a 100-year horizon, the significance lies less in immediate flow reductions (India lacks storage) than in eroding a rare, rules-based buffer between two nuclear rivals; once treaties are treated as coercive tools, future crises will have one fewer safety valve and South Asia’s 240 million downstream Pakistanis face a permanently politicised water lifeline.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian mainstream media (e.g., NDTV, english-language news sites based in India)**: The Pahalgam massacre proves Pakistan continues to sponsor cross-border terrorism, warranting India's decisive suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty and other punitive steps. Coverage amplifies the Modi government’s hard-line stance, taps nationalist sentiment and gives little attention to humanitarian or legal concerns over cutting Pakistan’s water supply.

- **Pakistani media (e.g., Dawn)**: India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty is an illegal provocation that can be treated as an act of war and evidence of New Delhi’s 'water terrorism' toward Pakistan. Reports foreground Pakistani victimhood and downplay or question militant links, rallying domestic opinion while sidestepping scrutiny of any support for armed groups.

- **International Western outlets (e.g., BBC, NPR)**: The tourist killings have set off a perilous tit-for-tat between two nuclear-armed neighbours, with analysts warning that any Indian military retaliation risks dangerous miscalculation. By dramatizing escalation scenarios and leaning on official statements, these reports may sensationalize the standoff and underplay deeper regional histories or civilian voices.
