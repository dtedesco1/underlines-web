# EU Issues First Digital Markets Act Penalty: €500 Million Fine Against Apple for App-Store ‘Anti-Steering’

On 24 April 2025 the European Commission fined Apple €500 million and ordered it to scrap fees and design blocks that stop iOS developers from directing users to cheaper, off-store payments—the inaugural use of the DMA’s penalty powers.

#### Focusing Facts

- Fine announced 24 Apr 2025: €500 m ($568 m) for breaching DMA Article 5(4) anti-steering obligation.

- Apple still charges >17 % commission on external transactions and a €0.50 per install ‘Core Technology Fee’, which the Commission says frustrates genuine third-party distribution.

- Apple has 60 days to comply or face recurring fines up to 5 % of daily global turnover; Meta was separately fined €200 m the same week for a ‘pay-or-consent’ ad model.

#### Context

Antitrust history rhymes: in 2004 Brussels levied €497 m on Microsoft for bundling Windows Media Player, forcing protocol disclosure; two decades later it wields the DMA to pre-empt similar gatekeeper lock-ins before dominance ossifies.  The shift is systemic—the EU is moving from slow, case-by-case antitrust (e.g., Google €4.3 bn 2018 fine after eight-year probe) to an ex-ante rulebook that can reset platform economics overnight.  Apple’s walled-garden model, born with the 2008 App Store after Steve Jobs’ initial reluctance, has scaled to over $100 bn in annual services revenue; pruning its tolls strikes at the heart of that margin machine.  On a 100-year timeline this moment tests whether sovereign regulators can curb private “digital states” the way the 1911 Standard Oil breakup checked industrial trusts— or whether tech firms will adapt, pay periodic fines, and keep collecting rents globally.  Either way, the EU is asserting regulatory hegemony that others—from India to California—may emulate, reshaping how software is distributed long after today’s iPhones are museum pieces.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European/international outlets amplifying the EU Commission’s stance**: Present the €500 million fine as a justified enforcement of the Digital Markets Act because Apple’s anti-steering rules harmed developers and kept consumers from cheaper choices. By stressing the “gravity and duration” of Apple’s misconduct and highlighting that Meta was also punished, these reports bolster the EU’s new regulatory power and may underplay Apple’s recent concessions cited in the same coverage.

- **Apple and U.S. political voices portrayed in American business press**: Frame the penalty as excessive, labelling it “economic extortion” that unfairly singles out successful American firms and threatens innovation and free trade. Nationalistic rhetoric from the White House and Apple’s own appeal foreground commercial interests and sovereignty concerns, while sidestepping detailed discussion of how App Store fees affect developers or users.

- **Apple-centric consumer tech media**: Celebrate the App Store’s meteoric growth to one billion downloads and note EU fines mainly as a footnote showing regulators now target Apple’s ‘astonishing success.’ The nostalgic focus on Apple milestones and quotes from Apple executives can romanticise the company’s walled-garden model and gloss over the antitrust issues regulators say still harm competition.
