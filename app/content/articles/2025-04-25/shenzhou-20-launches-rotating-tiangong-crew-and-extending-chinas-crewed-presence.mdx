# Shenzhou-20 Launches, Rotating Tiangong Crew and Extending China’s Crewed Presence in Orbit

On 24 April 2025, China fired the Shenzhou-20 spacecraft from Jiuquan, sending three astronauts to Tiangong for a six-month stint and relieving the Shenzhou-19 crew that has been aloft since October.

#### Focusing Facts

- Lift-off occurred at 17:17 CST (09:17 GMT) on 24 Apr 2025 aboard a Long March-2F rocket from the Gobi-desert Jiuquan site.

- The flight is China’s 15th crewed mission and the 20th launch in the three-decade-old Shenzhou program.

- The outgoing Shenzhou-19 crew is scheduled to land on 29 Apr 2025 after 175 days in orbit, marking Tiangong’s first period hosting six people simultaneously.

#### Context

Rotating a three-person crew to a national space station may look routine, yet history reminds us that ‘routine’ rotation is the tipping point between demonstration and permanence: the Soviet Union needed nine Salyut launches between 1971-1977 before achieving regular crew change-overs, and NASA only managed continuous occupation with the ISS in 2000.  China has reached that milestone barely 22 years after its first human spaceflight, and while the United States debates Artemis funding and Russia faces budget headwinds, Beijing is methodically reproducing—then iterating on—the orbital infrastructure others built a generation ago.  On a century horizon this speaks to a broader trend: access to near-Earth space is shifting from a U.S.–Russia duopoly toward a multipolar, potentially contested commons, where civil science, industrial production and military capabilities blur.  Whether this particular launch matters in 2125 will hinge less on the three taikonauts than on whether China can translate such cadence into sustained lunar logistics and international partnerships—or, conversely, whether fragmented blocs repeat the Cold-War cycle of parallel, non-interoperable stations that eventually crumble under cost and politics.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Chinese and China-friendly Asian media (e.g., CNA, South China Morning Post, The Manila Times)**: Portrays the Shenzhou-20 launch as another proud milestone toward President Xi’s “space dream,” stressing scientific experiments and China’s rapid advance toward a crewed Moon mission. Coverage is celebratory and nationalistic, largely sidestepping worries about military uses or geopolitical repercussions raised elsewhere.

- **Western outlets highlighting strategic rivalry (e.g., Sky News, NBC News, Euronews, Mirror)**: Frame the mission as evidence of an accelerating US-China space race, warning that Tiangong’s robotic arms and PLA control could threaten other nations’ satellites. Security-centric framing can amplify fear of Chinese intentions and minimize the scientific value of the mission, reflecting broader geopolitical competition narratives.

- **International wire services providing brief factual reports (e.g., Reuters, Asharq Al-Awsat)**: Report the basic who-what-when facts of the launch and place it as the 20th flight in the decades-old Shenzhou program, with minimal interpretation. The stripped-down style may appear impartial but can under-inform readers by omitting the wider scientific achievements or strategic controversies associated with the program.
