# Twelve U.S. States Sue in Court of International Trade to Halt Trump’s Emergency Tariffs

On 23–24 Apr 2025, a coalition of 12 state attorneys general filed suit in the U.S. Court of International Trade seeking an immediate injunction against President Trump’s newly announced global tariffs, arguing he exceeded his authority under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

#### Focusing Facts

- The complaint, Oregon et al. v. Trump, was lodged on 23 Apr 2025 and names Donald Trump, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, CBP Acting Commissioner Peter Flores, and the U.S. government as defendants.

- Tariffs at issue include a 145 % duty on all Chinese imports, 25 % on Canadian and Mexican goods, and a 10 % baseline on most other countries, announced after Trump’s 2 Apr 2025 "Liberation Day" order.

- Congressional Research Service notes that in the 48 years since enactment, no president has previously invoked IEEPA to levy tariffs.

#### Context

States rarely sue over trade, but the litigation echoes the 1952 Youngstown Sheet & Tube case where the Supreme Court curbed President Truman’s wartime steel seizure; both hinge on limits of emergency executive power.  Like Smoot-Hawley (1930) and Nixon’s 10 % import surcharge (1971), Trump’s tariffs test how far the U.S. executive can weaponize trade for domestic aims, yet this time by claiming a standing “national emergency.”  The suit spotlights two longer arcs: the post-1970s drift of trade authority from Congress to the White House, and the growing use of the courts by states to claw back federal prerogatives.  If the courts endorse Trump, future presidents—of any party—could set de facto tax policy without Congress, rewriting a separation-of-powers norm that has held since 1789; if they rebuke him, it may crystallize a counter-trend toward legislative reassertion, as seen in bipartisan bills now circulating.  On a century scale, the outcome will signal whether the U.S. continues its 21st-century turn toward unilateral economic nationalism or re-anchors trade policy in statutory process, shaping global supply chains—and constitutional balance—well beyond the current news cycle.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left-leaning and international mainstream outlets (e.g., The New York Times, The Guardian, BBC, NBC, CBS, Deutsche Welle)**: They highlight the lawsuit as proof that Trump’s sweeping tariffs are legally dubious, constitutionally over-reach, and economically destructive, stressing Democratic attorneys general’ claims that the policy is governed by the president’s ‘whims’. Coverage centres on economic harm and the legal case while giving scant weight to the White House’s national-security rationale, reflecting an editorial tendency to cast the Trump administration as chaotic and law-breaking. ([The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/states-tariff-trump-lawsuit.html), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/23/us-states-sue-trump-tariff-policy))

- **Right-leaning US mainstream media (Fox News)**: Frames the suit as another partisan ‘witch hunt’ by Democratic officials and underscores White House arguments that the tariffs are a bold tool to secure fair trade and confront national emergencies. Prominently platforms administration talking points and portrays Democratic attorneys general as politically motivated, minimising discussion of the constitutional critiques and potential consumer costs.

- **Pro-Trump partisan commentary sites (Independent Sentinel)**: Depicts the lawsuit as Democrats teaming up with ‘globalists’ to sabotage tariffs so that President Trump cannot notch a policy victory that would help Republicans in upcoming elections. Uses inflammatory language, asserts conspiratorial motives, and dismisses opposing legal arguments outright, reflecting a vested interest in rallying loyal readers against perceived anti-Trump forces.
