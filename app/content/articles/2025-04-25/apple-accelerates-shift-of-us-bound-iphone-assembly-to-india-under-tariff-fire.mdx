# Apple Accelerates Shift of U.S.-Bound iPhone Assembly to India Under Tariff Fire

Facing triple-digit Trump tariffs on China, Apple has told partners it will build the entire U.S. annual demand of 60-plus million iPhones in India by 2026, a timetable that forces a near-doubling of Indian output within 18 months.

#### Focusing Facts

- Apple assembled $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the 12 months to March 2025, exporting ₹1.5 trillion ($17.5 billion) of that volume, according to India’s IT minister.

- Trump’s latest ‘reciprocal’ tariffs impose 145 % duties on Chinese imports versus a paused 26 % rate for India, while smartphones from China still carry a 20 % levy.

- Export clearances for iPhone-making equipment leaving China for India have lengthened from two weeks to as much as four months, prompting suppliers to reroute machinery through third-country shell firms.

#### Context

Multinationals have uprooted factories before—IBM shifted transistor radio work from the U.S. to Japan in the late-1950s and HP moved printer lines to Singapore in the 1980s—but rarely on a clock this compressed or amid two nuclear-armed rivals skirmishing on a Himalayan border.  Apple’s pivot embodies three macro currents: the re-regionalization of supply chains after the 1990-2020 hyper-global era, the weaponization of tariffs and export controls as routine policy tools, and the rise of India as the first population-scale challenger to China’s manufacturing primacy since Deng’s reforms.  If Apple succeeds, it could validate a new bipolar tech geography—half China, half ‘rest of Asia’—that endures for decades; failure would reinforce China’s lock on high-volume, high-precision assembly.  Either outcome will echo for a century because whoever masters the phone supply chain tends to dominate adjacent devices (PCs in the 1990s, smartphones in the 2010s, mixed-reality headsets in the 2030s), setting the template for where the next generation of industrial jobs—and political leverage—reside.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian national media outlets**: They hail Apple’s manufacturing and retail expansion as a major boost for India’s economy and proof the country is becoming an indispensable production base for the iPhone. National pride and government-backed development narratives encourage these outlets to stress upside for India while downplaying lingering dependence on Chinese suppliers or geopolitical risks.

- **International business press**: They frame Apple’s pivot to India chiefly as a strategic hedge against Trump-era tariffs and US-China tensions, underscoring the financial and supply-chain logic behind the move. Investor-centric coverage may overstate how quickly Apple can execute the shift and gives limited attention to on-the-ground operational obstacles in India.

- **Tech industry blogs and Apple-watcher sites**: They spotlight the practical hurdles, reporting that Chinese authorities are blocking equipment exports and complicating Apple’s plan to scale up Indian production. Click-driven tech coverage leans on single-source anecdotes and dramatic wording that can exaggerate China’s obstruction and the immediacy of Apple’s challenges.
