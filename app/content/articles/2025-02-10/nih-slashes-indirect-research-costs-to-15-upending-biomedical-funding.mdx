# NIH Slashes Indirect Research Costs to 15%, Upending Biomedical Funding

On February 8, 2025, the NIH dramatically reduced its indirect cost funding from an average of 27–38% down to 15%, affecting existing and new grants and potentially crippling biomedical research infrastructure.

#### Focusing Facts

- Effective immediately from Feb 10, 2025, all NIH grants will apply a 15% cap on indirect costs instead of negotiated rates that sometimes exceed 50%.

- The policy cuts indirect funding from $9 billion out of the $35 billion FY2023 NIH grant portfolio, aiming to save $4 billion annually.

- The decision, rooted in conservative Project 2025 initiatives, faces widespread legal and academic opposition and may force universities to reallocate budgets abruptly.

#### Context

This move is reminiscent of earlier federal attempts to reform grant funding structures, such as the aborted 2017 proposal to cap overhead costs. It reflects a long-term trend toward restricting federal support for institutional infrastructure in favor of direct research spending, a shift that historically reshaped post-WWII U.S. scientific advancement. Over the next century, this recalibration could diminish the competitiveness of American biomedical research by straining the very facilities and administrative support that enable breakthrough innovations, echoing past transformations in public science funding.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media and academic voices**: They argue that the sudden cap on indirect funding will cripple vital biomedical research by undermining infrastructure and support essential for scientific breakthroughs. They may overemphasize the disastrous impacts on research and jobs in order to oppose the Trump administration’s cost-saving agenda. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/08/nih-cuts-billions-dollars-biomedical-funding-effective-immediately/), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/medical-research-funding-cuts-university-budgets.html))

- **Conservative and Trump administration allies**: They contend that capping indirect costs is a necessary reform to eliminate wasteful spending and align federal grant funding with private foundation practices. They might downplay the real needs of research institutions, prioritizing short-term government efficiency over long-term scientific investment.
