# Trump Escalates Trade War with 25% Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum

On February 10, 2025, President Trump announced a new 25% import tariff on steel and aluminum, signaling a significant escalation in his trade policy overhaul and setting the stage for reciprocal tariffs against trading partners.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump declared a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports as of February 10, 2025.

- Reciprocal tariffs matching foreign rates are set to be announced next week, effective Tuesday or Wednesday.

- China has retaliated with border taxes—15% on coal and LNG exports—further intensifying the multi-front trade conflict.

#### Context

This latest move mirrors historical instances of protectionism such as the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which deepened global trade rifts and economic downturns. Over the past century, trade wars have repeatedly surfaced as governments attempt to rebalance domestic industry protection against global competition. Trump’s renewed tariff measures reflect long-standing tensions between global supply chains and national economic interests, with potential cascading effects on international alliances and industrial policies over the next hundred years.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business-oriented media**: These outlets, including Yahoo! Finance and CNBC, report Trump's tariffs as a straightforward trade countermeasure designed to match foreign duties and protect domestic industries. They tend to present the measures in a factual, market-focused manner while downplaying potential broader economic fallout or political escalation. ([Yahoo!

- **Liberal media**: Sources like The Guardian and The New York Times frame the tariffs as an escalation of protectionist policies that risk igniting broader trade conflicts and destabilizing global markets. They may emphasize the negative implications of these tariffs and the targeting of countries like China, potentially downplaying any defensive trade rationale.

- **Financial analysis outlets**: Outlets such as the Financial Times view the tariffs as signals of a brewing multi-front trade war that could have significant repercussions for global supply chains and market stability. Their analysis might overstate risks and market volatility, focusing on potential economic disruptions over the intended protective benefits for domestic industries.
