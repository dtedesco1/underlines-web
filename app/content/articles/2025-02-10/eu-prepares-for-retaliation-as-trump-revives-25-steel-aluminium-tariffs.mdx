# EU Prepares for Retaliation as Trump Revives 25% Steel & Aluminium Tariffs

On February 10, 2025, President Trump announced new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium, prompting the EU Commission to pledge a defensive response pending official details.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump declared 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Feb 10, 2025.

- The EU Commission stated it will react to safeguard its economic interests only after receiving formal clarification of the tariffs.

- France and other EU members have signaled readiness to invoke countermeasures, including exploring digital trade restrictions under the Anti-Coercion Instrument.

#### Context

This incident recalls the 2018 trade conflict when Trump’s earlier tariffs led to EU countermeasures including tariffs on U.S. goods like bourbon and motorcycles. Over decades, transatlantic trade has been a stabilizing force post-World War II, but recurring disputes expose vulnerabilities within integrated global supply chains. While this renewed dispute could escalate tensions reminiscent of earlier clashes, its long-term significance may be limited by the deeply entrenched economic interdependence and the EU’s modern legal and strategic responses, which have evolved since the early 21st century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European Commission Official Messaging**: This perspective portrays Trump's proposed metal tariffs as unjustified and potentially unlawful, with the EU committed to defending its interests only after receiving formal clarification. Emphasizing official EU statements, this view may downplay broader economic impacts and reflect a reliance on government-sanctioned messaging.

- **Trade Conflict Narratives**: This group stresses the risk of an escalating trade war by recalling past tit-for-tat measures and warning of severe economic consequences if the tariffs go ahead. This framing can be seen as amplifying conflict and alarm, potentially sensationalizing the dispute based on historical trade tensions.

- **Strategic Economic Analysis**: This perspective explores alternative retaliation strategies, suggesting that the EU might shift focus toward targeting US tech services as a calculated countermeasure. Relying on speculative financial insights and market analyses, this view may prioritize theoretical economic models over firm policy statements.
