# Baltic States Sever Russian Energy Ties, Plug into EU Grid

On February 8-9, 2025, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania disconnected from the Russian-controlled power grid and initiated their integration with the EU's electricity network, marking a decisive shift in energy politics.

#### Focusing Facts

- Lithuania led the move by disconnecting at 07:43 local time (0543 GMT) on February 8, 2025.

- The Baltics invested nearly €1.6 billion since 2018 to upgrade their grids for the switch.

- The move isolated Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave from the mainland grid.

#### Context

This strategic decoupling echoes historical shifts seen after the Soviet Union's collapse in the early 1990s and, more recently, amid geopolitical tensions following Crimea's annexation in 2014 and Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. By severing their ties with a legacy Soviet-era system and embracing EU integration, the Baltic states reaffirm their long-standing aim of energy independence and security—a transformation that reshapes regional power dynamics and reduces the likelihood of energy being used as a political weapon. Over a centennial lens, similar realignments have periodically redrawn the geopolitical map of Europe, underscoring how energy infrastructure decisions today can entrench broader strategic orientations for generations to come.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western pro-EU media**: This group sees the Baltic states’ disconnection from the Russian grid as a historic move bolstering energy security, reinforcing European integration, and eliminating the threat of geopolitical blackmail. They may understate the technical, economic, or transitional challenges associated with such a major infrastructural shift in their celebratory framing. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/08/baltic-states-leave-russian-power-grid-in-closer-eu-integration), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/lithuania-cuts-russian-power-grid-ties-baltics-prepare-link-with-eu-2025-02-08/))

- **Russian state‐aligned media**: This group characterizes the Baltic disconnect as a politically motivated action that will drive up regional electricity prices, undermine grid reliability, and harm EU economic competitiveness. They tend to focus on economic disruptions while dismissing the security rationale, aligning with Moscow’s long-standing narrative against Western integration.
