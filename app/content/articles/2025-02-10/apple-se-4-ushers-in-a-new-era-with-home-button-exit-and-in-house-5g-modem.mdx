# Apple SE 4 Ushers in a New Era with Home Button Exit and In-House 5G Modem

Apple will announce its redesigned iPhone SE 4 next week, replacing the classic home button with a full-screen design featuring Face ID, USB-C, and its first in-house 5G modem.

#### Focusing Facts

- Announcement expected as early as next week in February 2025, with sales starting later in the month.

- The device upgrades include a 6.1-inch OLED display, A18 chip, transition from Qualcomm to an Apple-designed modem, and a shift to Face ID from Touch ID.

- Rumored pricing is around $500, marking a strategic repositioning in the competitive mid-range market.

#### Context

Apple’s SE 4 launch echoes historic transformations such as the 2012 introduction of Touch ID with the iPhone 5s, signifying a long-term trend of modernizing entry-level devices. The shift away from the home button—a feature dating back to the original iPhone in 2007—reflects broader industry movements towards more integrated, high-tech interfaces. Coupled with Apple’s foray into in-house modem technology following its 2019 acquisition of Intel’s modem division, this move illustrates a strategic effort to own more of its technology stack. While this reinvention enhances its competitive stance in the mid-range segment, on a 100-year timescale, it represents a continuous evolution in consumer tech rather than a sudden disruptive overhaul.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Tech-focused media**: These outlets view the new iPhone SE as an overdue modernization of Apple’s budget line, emphasizing its updated design (larger screen, Face ID, USB-C) and the debut of an in-house 5G modem as essential steps for keeping pace with flagship models. They often rely on leaked information and insider predictions, which can lead to sensationalism or overhyping unverified features.

- **Business and financial media**: This group interprets the impending launch as a strategic move by Apple to alleviate market pressures, boost sales, and pre-empt regulatory challenges, by quickly updating its mid-range offerings. They tend to focus on market implications and business strategy, which might underplay the technical or experiential details in favor of financial metrics and competitive positioning.
