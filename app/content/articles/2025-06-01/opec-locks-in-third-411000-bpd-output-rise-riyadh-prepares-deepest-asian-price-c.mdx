# OPEC+ Locks In Third 411,000-bpd Output Rise; Riyadh Prepares Deepest Asian Price Cut Since January

On 31 May 2025, the OPEC+ alliance approved another 411 kb/d production hike for July, the third in as many months, pushing crude to a four-year low and forcing Saudi Aramco to signal a July Asian price cut to a six-month trough.

#### Focusing Facts

- Total additional supply committed for Apr-Jul now reaches 1.233 million bpd (3 × 411 kb/d).

- Arab Light’s July OSP is expected to drop $0.40-0.50 to a $0.90-$1.00/bbl premium over Oman/Dubai, the weakest since Jan 2025, affecting ~9 mb/d of Asian imports.

- Brent futures slid to roughly $65/bbl, down from the mid-$80s peak in January, after the successive OPEC+ hikes.

#### Context

This move echoes the 1986 Saudi-led flood that shattered the $30 oil floor and the brief 2020 price war when Riyadh and Moscow opened the taps amid Covid demand collapse.  Both episodes aimed to discipline quota-breakers and protect market share, but they also accelerated structural shifts—first ushering in North Sea spot trading in the 1980s, then spurring U.S. shale resilience in the 2010s.  Today’s incremental 1.2 mb/d reversal of cuts signals a similar pivot: the cartel is prioritizing market control and refining margin capture over headline prices, leveraging Saudi Arabia’s 7 mb/d refining system to cushion fiscal pain.  In the century-long arc of oil governance, such supply-side gambits tend to erode the credibility of fixed-price management and invite faster diversification by importers and producers alike.  Whether this moment ultimately resembles 1986’s multi-year glut or merely a tactical feint will shape budgets from Riyadh to Moscow and, by extension, the geopolitical leverage of petrostates through mid-century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream business press (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters)**: They frame OPEC+’s extra 411,000-bpd output hike as a dramatic policy reversal that is dragging crude to multi-year lows and threatening producer revenues. Coverage centres on the immediate price impact for investors, so it stresses bearish market sentiment while giving scant attention to OPEC+’s longer-term strategic aims.

- **Energy-industry commentary platforms (e.g., OilPrice.com, Reuters opinion via Zawya)**: Commentators argue the Kingdom can cushion the blow from cheaper crude because record refinery runs and strong product margins let it profit even as it leads a price war with higher output. By spotlighting Saudi Arabia’s operational savvy, these writers risk overstating Riyadh’s resilience and underplaying the fiscal strain highlighted even within their own reports.

- **Market-oriented financial outlets tracking trading sentiment (e.g., Nasdaq Stock Market)**: They suggest that any bearish effect from extra OPEC+ supply could be offset as crude rallies on looming U.S. sanctions against Russia and heightened Middle-East tensions. This angle accentuates headline-driven geopolitical risk—fuel for short-term trading plays—while downplaying structural oversupply repeatedly cited in the same pieces.
