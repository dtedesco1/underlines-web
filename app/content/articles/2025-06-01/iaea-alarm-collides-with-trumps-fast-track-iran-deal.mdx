# IAEA Alarm Collides with Trump’s Fast-Track Iran Deal

In the last week of May 2025, U.N. inspectors reported Iran’s near-weapons-grade uranium stockpile has doubled while President Trump pressed ahead with a draft agreement and told Israel to stand down, setting up an IAEA breach vote for June 9.

#### Focusing Facts

- IAEA confidential report (circulated 31 May) says Iran added ~300 lb of 60 % enriched uranium since February, lifting the total to about 900 lb—enough for roughly 10 bombs if enriched further.

- Wall Street Journal revealed 30 May that Trump warned Netanyahu against striking Iran as Washington contemplates dropping the ‘zero-enrichment’ demand to clinch a deal.

- US-E3 diplomats intend to table the first resolution since Sept 2005 to declare Iran in safeguards breach at the IAEA Board meeting opening 9 June.

#### Context

Great-power bargaining over atomic ambition has a long, seesaw history: the 1994 Agreed Framework slowed North Korea but collapsed within a decade; the 2015 JCPOA bought time but was torpedoed in 2018. Today’s mix of rising Iranian enrichment and an American president eager for a ‘Nixon-goes-to-Tehran’ legacy echoes both precedents—temporary caps traded for political theatre, while centrifuges keep spinning underground. Structural forces drive this moment: Iran’s mastery of advanced IR-6 machines, Israel’s shrinking window for pre-emption, Gulf monarchies’ fear of radioactive fallout, and Washington’s post-Iraq fatigue with regime-change wars. Whether the current pivot forestalls conflict or merely resets the countdown matters far beyond 2025; on a century horizon, each failed non-proliferation bargain nudges the world toward a normalized, multipolar nuclear order in the Middle East, much as the 1964 Chinese test cracked the five-power monopoly. The stakes are planetary, yet the window for durable verification—before technology diffusion makes denial impossible—is rapidly closing.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli security-focused outlets and officials (e.g., The Times of Israel, The Jerusalem Post, Ynet via PravdaReport)**: Warn that Washington is poised to cut a dangerously weak deal with Tehran that could block Israel’s right to strike and leave Iran only months from a bomb. Emphasises worst-case threats and military solutions to safeguard Israel’s strategic freedom, likely magnifying Iran’s immediacy as an existential danger to justify potential unilateral action. ([The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israel-worried-us-may-drop-demand-for-iran-to-cease-enriching-uranium-to-speed-up-negotiations-wsj-report/), [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-855963))

- **Mainstream U.S./U.K. news organisations (e.g., Washington Post, New York Times, Reuters, BBC, AP)**: Report Iran’s rapid enrichment gains and IAEA alarms while portraying continuing U.S.–Iran talks under Trump as a cautious but still viable diplomatic path to curb the program. Rely heavily on official Western and IAEA sources, framing events through a negotiations-first lens that can underplay Israeli military arguments and echo Washington’s preference for diplomacy. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/31/iran-nuclear-uranium-enrichment-trump/), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/us/politics/iran-nuclear.html))

- **Libertarian/anti-intervention commentary (Lew Rockwell)**: Depicts Trump’s Gulf tour as forming an ‘Axis of the Plutocrats’ that sidelines Israel, dampens neocon wars and pursues money over militarism, with little worry about Iran. Skeptical of U.S. alliances and overtly critical of Israel, it downplays Tehran’s nuclear risk and casts foreign policy chiefly as profiteering, reflecting ideological opposition to American interventionism.
