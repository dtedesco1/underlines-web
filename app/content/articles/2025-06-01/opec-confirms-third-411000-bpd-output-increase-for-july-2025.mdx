# OPEC+ Confirms Third 411,000-bpd Output Increase for July 2025

On 31 May 2025 the eight-nation OPEC+ steering group voted by video-conference to lift the alliance’s July quota by another 411,000 barrels per day, its third straight monthly hike and a clear break from its years-long price-defence strategy.

#### Focusing Facts

- Total planned additions now reach 1.233 million bpd for May-July 2025 (411 kbpd each month).

- Brent slid to ≈US$64/bbl after the April-May announcements, far below Saudi Arabia’s IMF-estimated fiscal breakeven of >US$90/bbl.

- Russia, Algeria and Oman argued for a pause, but Saudi-led delegates pushed the rise through in the 31 May call.

#### Context

Saudi Arabia’s move echoes its 2014–2015 decision to flood the market—when prices collapsed from $110 to $30—to squeeze U.S. shale, and the March 2020 output surge that briefly drove WTI to –$37/bbl. Each episode showed Riyadh willing to sacrifice price for strategic leverage. Today’s third consecutive hike underscores two long arcs: (1) OPEC’s internal cohesion is fraying as quota-cheating proliferates and smaller members are shut out of decision-making; (2) hydrocarbon producers are increasingly willing to trade short-term revenue for market share before an energy-transition peak in oil demand, now forecast within two decades. Whether this gambit disciplines over-producers, kneecaps high-cost shale, or merely deepens fiscal holes in petrostates will shape capital flows into oil infrastructure for the next cycle. On a century scale, these decisions may be footnotes beside the eventual decline of fossil fuels, but they illustrate how resource powers use price to project geopolitical influence even as the clock on oil’s dominance ticks down.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Global financial and energy trade press (Financial Post, Rigzone, MoneyControl, BusinessLine)**: Portray the Saudi-led OPEC+ output surge as a calculated market move to recapture share, discipline quota cheats and satisfy robust demand even at the cost of lower prices. Because these outlets cater to investors and industry professionals, their coverage foregrounds price mechanics and corporate impacts while sidelining geopolitical, environmental or consumer angles. ([Financial Post](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/opec-mulls-even-larger-oil-output-hike-as-it-seeks-market-share), [Rigzone](https://www.rigzone.com/news/wire/opec_mulls_even_larger_oil_output_hike_as_it_seeks_market_share-30-may-2025-180695-article/))

- **Mainstream U.S. regional newspaper (The Spokesman Review)**: Stresses that the production hike reflects Riyadh’s desire to please President Trump and exploit a window of strong summer demand, signalling a sharp policy break from the Biden era. By linking the move heavily to domestic U.S. politics, the report may overstate Washington’s influence and underplay intra-OPEC economic calculations to resonate with its American readership.

- **Right-leaning, anti-establishment financial blog (Zero Hedge)**: Frames the decision as the prelude to another Saudi-driven price war that could crash markets and punish disobedient members like Kazakhstan while courting Trump. Its dramatic, conspiratorial tone and focus on worst-case scenarios serve to stoke reader outrage and skepticism toward mainstream narratives, sometimes outpacing the evidence presented.
