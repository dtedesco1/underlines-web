# IAEA Discloses 50 % Surge in Iran’s 60 % Uranium Stockpile Amid Trump-Led Deal Push

On 31 May 2025 a pair of leaked IAEA reports revealed Iran now holds 408.6 kg of 60 %-enriched uranium—up nearly half since February—just as President Trump presses for a new accord and asks Israel to stay its hand.

#### Focusing Facts

- IAEA inventory dated 17 May 2025: 408.6 kg of 60 % U-235, a 133.8 kg increase from the February tally of 274.8 kg.

- IAEA “comprehensive report” concludes three undeclared sites (Turquzabad, Varamin, Marivan) were part of a covert Iranian nuclear programme using undeclared material until the early 2000s.

- 29 May 2025: Trump publicly confirmed he told Netanyahu to delay any strike on Iran while U.S.–Iran talks proceed.

#### Context

Iran’s enrichment sprint echoes other high-stakes nuclear bargaining gambits—the USSR’s 1962 missile deployment in Cuba and North Korea’s 2003 reactor restart both leveraged technical advances to force negotiations.  Since the 1950s, the non-proliferation regime has relied on a carrot-and-stick cycle: clandestine progress, sanctions, then deals (e.g., the 2015 JCPOA) that buy time but rarely resolve the security calculus driving enrichment.  Today’s spike signals Tehran’s bid for negotiating leverage while a second-term U.S. president, courting Gulf investment and cooling on Israel, weighs economic pragmatism over military action—reversing the neocon model of the 2000s.  Over a 100-year horizon, whether this moment yields a durable inspection framework or normalises 60 % enrichment by non-weapon states will shape the credibility of the NPT itself; erosion could spur a regional cascade reminiscent of post-1945 nuclear diffusion, whereas a deal that reins Iran back could prolong the seventy-year pattern of keeping the bomb club small.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli security-focused media (e.g., The Times of Israel)**: Iran’s surging stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium proves Tehran is racing toward a bomb, and Washington may dangerously dilute red-line demands in negotiations, undermining Israel’s right to strike first if necessary. Coverage consistently frames developments through Israel’s security lens, amplifying worst-case scenarios to keep military options and U.S. pressure on the table, a stance that can overstate threats to justify pre-emptive action. ([The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israel-worried-us-may-drop-demand-for-iran-to-cease-enriching-uranium-to-speed-up-negotiations-wsj-report/), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-has-further-increased-production-of-near-weapons-grade-uranium-un-watchdog-says/))

- **Mainstream Western outlets (e.g., Reuters, BBC, AP, Washington Post, New York Times)**: IAEA data show a worrisome jump in 60 % enriched uranium, yet ongoing U.S.–Iran talks and IAEA inspections are portrayed as viable paths to defuse the crisis diplomatically before weapons-grade levels are reached. Reliance on official statements and multilateral diplomacy narratives may underplay regional actors’ skepticism and minimize discussion of enforcement failures, balancing access journalism with caution not to derail negotiations.

- **Libertarian/anti-interventionist commentary (e.g., Lew Rockwell)**: Trump’s Gulf-centric ‘Axis of the Plutocrats’ sidelines Israel and neocon war plans, suggesting his realignment could curb costly U.S. military adventures while exposing Israeli expansionism in Syria and beyond. Ideological hostility to U.S. alliances with Israel and the foreign-policy establishment leads to downplaying Iran’s nuclear risk and framing events primarily as self-serving elite profiteering, which can skew factual weighting.
