# Israeli Fire Kills Dozens Queuing at US-Backed Gaza Aid Site

On 1 June 2025 Israeli tanks and troops opened fire on Palestinians waiting for food at the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation distribution point near Rafah, leaving at least 20 dead and 175 wounded according to the Red Cross field hospital.

#### Focusing Facts

- Red Cross-run Rafah field hospital received 20 corpses and treated 175 wounded from the 04:30 local shooting, hospital officials told AP and BBC.

- Witnesses said Israeli armour fired from roughly 300 m; similar incidents on 29–31 May had already killed at least 22 civilians near other GHF sites, Anadolu and France 24 reported.

- The GHF, launched this week with US-Israeli backing, claims to have distributed 2 million meals but relies on armed contractors after Israel restricted UN aid convoys.

#### Context

Militarised food lines being shot at recall Biafra’s 1968 ‘relief corridors’ where Nigerian forces starved separatist areas while controlling aid, and Somalia’s 1992 firefights around UN convoys.  The episode fits a decades-long trend of besieging civilian populations (from Sarajevo 1992–95 to Mariupol 2022) and bypassing multilateral agencies with politically-aligned ‘humanitarian’ mechanisms.  If a century of humanitarian law—from the 1864 Geneva Convention through the 1977 Additional Protocols—was meant to shield non-combatants, these Rafah killings signal the erosion of that norm: food is again a weapon and relief is filtered through security optics.  Whether this hardens into an accepted precedent or provokes legal and diplomatic limits will shape how states wage sieges—and how civilians survive them—well into the 2100s.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (e.g., Common Dreams, The Guardian)**: Describes Israel’s assault on Gaza as a genocidal campaign backed by the United States and claims civilian deaths are far higher than official figures, demanding accountability for Netanyahu. Heavy reliance on activist language and sources may exaggerate casualty estimates and overlook Hamas abuses, reflecting an ideological drive to cast Israel as the sole aggressor. ([Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/us-media-bias-netanyahu), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/01/palestinians-killed-food-distribution-gaza-strip-israel-middle-east-crisis-live))

- **Mainstream international outlets (e.g., BBC, CNN International, France 24)**: Detail the humanitarian crisis and large-scale displacement caused by Israel’s latest military operations while quoting both Israeli and Palestinian accounts of events. Efforts to balance sources can dilute moral clarity and normalize prolonged conflict, possibly influenced by institutional caution toward alienating wide audiences or official access. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c991j01lym3o), [CNN International](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/31/middleeast/israel-gaza-strip-occupation-resources-dg))

- **Turkish and regional pro-Palestinian media (e.g., Anadolu Ajansı, Daily Sabah)**: Frame Israel’s offensive as an ongoing genocidal war that is starving Gaza’s population, stressing ICC warrants and accusing Israel of deliberate crimes against civilians. State-aligned editorial lines use charged terminology and seldom mention Hamas violence, advancing Ankara’s geopolitical narrative and reinforcing a one-sided view of the conflict.
