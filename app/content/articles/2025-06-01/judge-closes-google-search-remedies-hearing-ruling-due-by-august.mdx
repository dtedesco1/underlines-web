# Judge Closes Google Search Remedies Hearing, Ruling Due by August

On 30 May 2025, Judge Amit Mehta ended the remedies phase of the Google search-monopoly trial, moving the case into deliberation on penalties that could re-shape the company.

#### Focusing Facts

- DOJ asked Mehta to order a divestiture of the Chrome browser, which trial evidence showed drives about 35 % of Google’s search traffic.

- Prosecutors also want Google’s $20 billion-a-year default-search deal with Apple banned and its search index licensed to competitors.

- Google has said it will seek an immediate stay and appeal once Mehta issues his remedy decision.

#### Context

Big antitrust showdowns tend to peak only once a generation: Standard Oil’s 1911 breakup created 34 separate firms; the 1998–2001 Microsoft case forced API disclosure but stopped short of a split.  In each instance regulators reacted to a bottleneck technology (rail-served oil, desktop operating systems) that risked throttling the next wave of innovation.  Today the bottleneck is the data and distribution funnel of search just as generative AI threatens to redefine what “search” even is.  Whether Mehta opts for surgical limits or a Chrome spinoff, his ruling will test a broader post-Chicago antitrust revival that is challenging data-era giants from Google to Amazon.  On a century horizon, the decision matters less for what happens to one browser and more for whether democratic institutions can still reset market power when technology platforms morph faster than the law can.  If regulators fail, history suggests dominance can persist for decades; if they succeed, the ruling could mark a pivot point similar to telecom’s 1984 divestiture that opened the path to the internet itself.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business-friendly finance and tech outlets (e.g., Yahoo! Finance)**: Frame the remedies fight mainly as government over-reach that could hobble an innovative U.S. champion and hurt partners like Apple, echoing industry voices who deem a Chrome sell-off or forced data-sharing “very unlikely” and potentially harmful to Google’s incentives. Coverage leans on lobbyists such as the Chamber of Progress and stresses stock-market repercussions, so it downplays anticompetitive findings and treats Google’s warnings as credible business risks.

Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fate-of-googles-search-empire-is-now-up-to-a-judge-190530934.html))

- **Public-interest and policy outlets often associated with center-left audiences (e.g., NPR, The Hill, PBS, The New York Times)**: Highlight the DOJ’s push for sweeping remedies as a necessary step to ‘pry open’ a search market frozen by Google’s decade-long monopoly and to prevent the company from leveraging that power to dominate AI. Stories foreground regulators’ arguments about competition and consumer welfare, so they may understate the complexity of implementing divestitures or the privacy/security risks flagged by Google and other experts.

- **Global business newswires and policy trackers (e.g., Reuters, Axios)**: Cast the showdown as a pivotal but uncertain legal inflection point, noting both the DOJ’s maximalist proposals and the judge’s search for a ‘middle ground’ while stressing how AI upends traditional search and what any ruling means for investors and rival tech firms. Wire-style emphasis on procedural developments and market impact can create a both-sides equivalence that glosses over the structural harm to competition already found by the court.
