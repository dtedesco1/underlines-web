# Israel–US ‘Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’ Replaces UN Convoys, Begins Guarded Food Hand-outs

Across 28–31 May 2025 Israel blocked Jordan/Egypt aid routes and funneled relief through the brand-new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which opened two secure hubs and started handing out food directly to Palestinians under IDF overwatch.

#### Focusing Facts

- GHF claims 17,820 boxes—about 1.84 million meals—distributed in its first three days of operation (28-30 May 2025).

- UNRWA holds 200,000 mt of flour and tens of thousands of meal kits in Jordan warehouses, some expiring July 2025, after Israel barred their entry since March.

- GHF’s founding CEO Jake Wood resigned on 25 May 2025, saying the group could not meet core humanitarian principles.

#### Context

The move echoes the 1948–49 Berlin Airlift, when the West bypassed a Soviet blockade to supply West Berlin; unilateral logistics solved an immediate crisis but hardened geopolitical lines for decades.  Here, a state-backed private outfit is sidestepping the UN, reflecting two deeper currents: the erosion of faith in multilateral agencies and the growing use of food corridors as instruments of military strategy, already visible in Yemen’s blockade and Syria’s cross-line convoys.  If this precedence sticks, future wars may normalise ‘militarised philanthropy’—aid tied to displacement corridors and gun barrels—undercutting the post-1945 norm that relief is neutral, voluntary and multilateral.  Over a century, who controls the food supply shapes legitimacy more than firepower; today’s experiment may therefore recalibrate humanitarian law long after the Gaza guns fall silent.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning American and Israeli media (e.g., Breitbart, The Daily Wire, The Jerusalem Post, Jewish News Syndicate)**: They portray the new U.S.– and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation as a successful, corruption-free alternative that finally feeds Gazans without Hamas or U.N. interference. By celebrating Trump-era policy and Israeli coordination they dismiss or downplay reports of Israeli fire, civilian deaths, and broader aid restrictions, reflecting ideological incentives to show conservative and pro-Israel initiatives in the best light.

- **Liberal / progressive Western outlets (e.g., NPR, The Guardian)**: They stress that Israel’s blockade and new rules are leaving mountains of U.N. food rotting while the opaque GHF model forces desperate Palestinians to travel through militarised checkpoints and still receive only a "trickle" of aid. Reliance on U.N. and NGO officials and a critical posture toward Israeli policy may lead them to under-report Hamas diversion of aid or early GHF successes, reinforcing a narrative that Western governments allied with Israel bear primary blame.

- **Al Jazeera and other Arab outlets sympathetic to the Palestinian cause**: They describe Gaza as the "hungriest place on Earth," accuse Israel of deliberate starvation and shooting civilians, and label GHF a coercive tool to displace Palestinians in violation of international law. Funded by a Qatari network long aligned with Palestinian narratives, coverage emphasises Israeli wrongdoing and humanitarian catastrophe while accepting Hamas-sourced casualty figures and giving little weight to evidence of aid theft by militants.
