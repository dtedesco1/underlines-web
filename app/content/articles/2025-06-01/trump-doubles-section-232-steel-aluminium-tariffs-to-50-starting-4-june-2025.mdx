# Trump Doubles Section 232 Steel & Aluminium Tariffs to 50 % Starting 4 June 2025

On 31 May 2025, President Trump said levies on all imported steel and aluminium will rise from 25 % to 50 % effective 4 June, abruptly upending ongoing exemption talks with allies.

#### Focusing Facts

- Canada supplied 24 % of U.S. steel imports in 2023 and a C$15 bn industry now faces the higher rate, according to the Canadian Steel Producers Association.

- The EU warned that expanded counter-tariffs will automatically activate by 14 July 2025 unless the U.S. reverses course.

- Trump touted a US$14-15 bn partnership between U.S. Steel and Japan’s Nippon Steel while promising each American steelworker a US$5,000 bonus.

#### Context

Tariff hikes of this magnitude recall the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, which raised duties on over 20,000 goods and worsened global retaliation during the Great Depression.  Like Trump’s first-term 25 % metal tariffs of 2018, the new 50 % rate is justified under Cold-War-era Section 232 national-security powers; the courts again allowed it to stand, underscoring the broad executive leeway Congress granted in 1962.  The move fits a broader twenty-first-century trend toward weaponising supply chains—seen also in China’s rare-earth export controls (2010, 2023) and U.S. semiconductor bans (2022)—and signals that post-1990s hyper-globalisation is still in retreat.  On a 100-year horizon, whether this moment matters hinges on feedback loops: if partners mimic Smoot-Hawley-style retaliation and investment shifts, the tariff could crystallise a new era of regionalised, security-driven trade blocs; if not, it may be remembered as yet another short-lived election-cycle flourish in the long, jagged decline of the integrated steel age.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Pro-Trump nationalist media (e.g., InfoWars)**: Presents the 50 % steel and aluminium tariff as a patriotic, security-driven boost that will resurrect American manufacturing and directly reward U.S. steelworkers. Closely mirrors White House rhetoric, glossing over higher consumer prices and the risk of foreign retaliation to rally populist support. ([InfoWars](https://www.infowars.com/posts/trump-doubles-steel-tariffs))

- **European Union institutions and continental political press (e.g., POLITICO Europe, BBC’s Brussels coverage)**: Cast the tariff hike as an unjustified U.S. escalation that threatens EU industry and requires the bloc to deploy swift counter-measures. Motivated to defend European economic interests, the coverage accents readiness to retaliate and may overstate EU cohesion while downplaying any benefits U.S. producers might gain.

- **UK & Commonwealth free-trade advocates in mainstream press (e.g., BBC UK business desks, Sky News Australia)**: Portray the doubled tariffs as another severe blow that imperils British and Australian steel producers and urge their governments to negotiate rapid exemptions instead of retaliating. Coverage is shaped by domestic industrial anxiety, highlighting local job risks and lobbying power while skimming over the long-term vulnerabilities of their own steel sectors.
