# Ukraine Ends Russian Gas Transit, Jolting Europe's Supply

On January 1, 2025, Ukraine ended its gas transit agreement with Russia, halting 4% of Europe's supply.

#### Focusing Facts

- Europe's gas imports from Russia have fallen from 142 to 30 billion cubic metres since 2021.

- Germany's gas storage is 80% full but requires a 20% consumption cut to avoid shortages.

- EU imported â‚¬7.32bn worth of Russian LNG in 2024, despite aiming for energy independence by 2027.


#### Narrow Perspectives

| European Union (EU) policymakers | EU policymakers argue that despite the cessation of Russian gas via Ukraine, Europe is well-prepared with alternative sources and has managed to maintain a steady supply, mitigating potential shortages. | The EU's public stance might be influenced by a need to showcase resilience and policy success despite challenges, in order to maintain political stability and public confidence. | [Euronews English](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/07/commission-insists-eu-faces-no-gas-squeeze-as-winter-bites) [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/09/european-imports-of-liquefied-natural-gas-from-russia-at-record-levels) |
| Ukrainian Government | The Ukrainian government stopped the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine to apply economic pressure on Russia and re-align with Western energy partners like the U.S. | Ukraine's stance is influenced by geopolitical strategies to weaken Russian influence and strengthen connections with Western allies in its bid for EU membership. | [CNA](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/russia-gas-exports-supply-stop-europe-ukraine-slovakia-politics-energy-4844966) [Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/russia-ukraine-energy-divorce-offers-chance-europe-energy-security/) |
| Gazprom / Russian Government | Gazprom and Russia blame Ukraine for the rise in energy prices in Europe, asserting that Ukraine's refusal to extend the gas transit contract has led to increased costs and challenges for the EU. | Russia's perspective is shaped by economic losses and political motivations to portray Ukraine as unreliable and to challenge EU's sanctions. | [RT](https://www.rt.com/news/610558-eu-ukraine-hungary-gas/) [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmarkind/2025/01/07/if-europe-freezes-will-ukraine-burn/) |
| German Industrial Sector | Germany's industrial sector is suffering due to high gas prices and shortages, attributed to its reduced reliance on Russian gas and the energy crisis impacting production costs. | The perspective may reflect economic pressures and a resistance to moving away from cheaper Russian gas due to industrial demands. | [NaturalNews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-01-08-germany-energy-regulator-households-businesses-conserve-shortages.html) [EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1997265/energy-bill-rise-warning-europe-gas-crisis) |

#### Context

Historically, Russia has used its energy supplies as a political tool, similar to the 2006 and 2009 gas disputes with Ukraine, which saw significant supply disruptions in Europe. This event reflects a continued shift away from Russian energy dependence that began in earnest after the Ukraine invasion in 2022. The intervention is crucial as it pushes Europe to consider energy diversification, challenging long-standing economic dependencies. For Ukraine, it aligns with its strategic pivot towards Western alliances and energy independence, directly impacting its geopolitical stance amid ongoing conflict. However, this comes at a critical time when Europe's energy crisis is being compounded by severe winter weather, making energy supplies tight and causing economic ripples across the continent. The decision's broader impact hinges on Europe's ability to transition to renewable energy and the geopolitical balances this shift entails, especially with impending U.S. political changes signifying altered transatlantic energy dynamics.
