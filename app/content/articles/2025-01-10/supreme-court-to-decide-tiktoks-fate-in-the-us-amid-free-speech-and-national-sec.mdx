# Supreme Court to Decide TikTok's Fate in the US Amid Free Speech and National Security Debate

The US Supreme Court will hear arguments regarding a law that could ban TikTok in the US unless it severs ties with its Chinese parent company, citing national security risks.

#### Focusing Facts

- The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was passed in 2024, mandating TikTok's divestment from ByteDance by January 19, 2025.

- On December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the divest-or-ban law, acknowledging its national security justifications over First Amendment rights.

- TikTok rival platform Lemon8 saw a 150% increase in US downloads in December 2024 amid TikTok's uncertain future.


#### Narrow Perspectives

| Group | General Perspective | Possible Bias | Sources |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| US Government - National Security Advocates | The ban on TikTok is essential to protect national security due to risks associated with its ownership by ByteDance, which could allow the Chinese government access to data and potential influence operations. | This perspective may be influenced by geopolitical tensions and security concerns related to China's global influence. | [NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/us/tiktok-ban-social-media/2025/01/08/id/1194284/) [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/01/08/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-trump-biden/77483641007/) |
| TikTok and TikTok Creators | The law banning TikTok violates First Amendment rights, and its enforcement would unfairly curtail free speech for millions of American users. | These views are likely influenced by economic interests, as the ban could negatively impact TikTok and its creators who rely on the platform for income and communication. | [Yahoo!

| Civil Liberties Groups | The TikTok ban is a threat to free speech and sets a dangerous precedent of government overreach under the guise of national security. | Their stance is shaped by a strong commitment to civil liberties, prioritizing free speech over speculative security threats. | [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2025/01/08/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-first-amendment/) [Roanoke Times](https://roanoke.com/news/nation-world/social-media-tiktok-creators-in-limbo-supreme-court-possible-ban/article_fe9903ec-08cb-56d3-8312-97013213c427.html) |
| President-elect Donald Trump | President-elect Donald Trump has shifted positions and now opposes banning TikTok, emphasizing the platform's potential for political engagement and advocating for a political resolution. | Trump's perspective is possibly biased by his own political interests and popularity on the platform, along with a strategic stance against technology restrictions. | [NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/us/tiktok-ban-social-media/2025/01/08/id/1194284/) [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/01/08/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-trump-biden/77483641007/) |
| Republican Lawmakers and State Attorneys General | Many Republican lawmakers support the TikTok ban as they believe it prevents national security threats from China, opposing Trump's changed stance. | Their view might be influenced by political alignment with broader conservative concerns about China and data security. | [NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/us/tiktok-ban-social-media/2025/01/08/id/1194284/) [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/01/08/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-trump-biden/77483641007/) |

#### Context

1. Historical Analogy: During World War II, the US government interned many Japanese Americans over fears they might aid Japan, which is a comparable instance where national security concerns led to severe restrictions on civil liberties. Similarly, the TikTok case raises questions about balancing national security against free expression.
2. Long-term Trends/Systems: This legal battle highlights the growing tension between the US and China, particularly in technology and data privacy. The case is emblematic of a broader geopolitical conflict where technology and information flow are key battlegrounds, showing a continued trend toward digital sovereignty.
3. Significance: The Supreme Court's decision will set a major precedent for how the US handles foreign digital influence, impacting not just TikTok but also future dealings with similar apps. This ruling carries implications for free speech, governmental power, and international relations, potentially shaping the digital landscape for years to come.
