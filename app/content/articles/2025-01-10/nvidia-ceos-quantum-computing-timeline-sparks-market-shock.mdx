# Nvidia CEO's Quantum Computing Timeline Sparks Market Shock

Jensen Huang's comments about a 15-30 year timeline for "very useful" quantum computers led to a massive selloff in quantum computing stocks, erasing about $8 billion in market value.

#### Focusing Facts

- IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave shares plunged over 40%, 45%, and 36%, respectively, after Huang's statement.

- D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz claims quantum computers are already in use with clients like Mastercard and NTT Docomo.

- Google's Willow quantum chip launch in December had previously rallied quantum stocks.

| Quantum Computing Companies (e.g., D-Wave, Rigetti, IonQ) | These companies are critical of Nvidia's Jensen Huang's comments, arguing that useful quantum applications and commercial products already exist today. | These companies have a direct financial stake in the perception and valuation of quantum computing technology and its immediate promise. | [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-is-dead-wrong-about-quantum-d-wave-ceo.html) [The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-one-sentence-wiped-out-8-billion-in-market-cap-of-quantum-computing-companies/articleshow/117071979.cms) |
| Investors in Quantum Computing Stocks | Investors have reacted with skepticism and disappointment to the long timelines for quantum computing suggested by Nvidia's Huang, resulting in a substantial sell-off. | Investors are primarily driven by short-term returns and market sentiment, causing rapid shifts in stock valuations based on industry leader comments. | [Yahoo!

#### Context

In the 2000s, similar market behaviors occurred in reaction to comments by influential tech leaders, such as when Steve Jobs' remarks affected Apple stock in 2011. Quantum computing's hype cycle parallels past technological cycles where initial excitement often overshoots practical readiness, similar to the early dot-com bubble. This event highlights the persistent volatility and speculative nature of emerging tech stocks. The market's reaction underscores both the influence of corporate leaders on stock perceptions and the impatience for breakthrough technologies despite their long-term developmental timelines.
