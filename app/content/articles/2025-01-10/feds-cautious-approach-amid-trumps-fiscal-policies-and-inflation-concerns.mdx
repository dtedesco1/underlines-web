# Fed's Cautious Approach Amid Trump's Fiscal Policies and Inflation Concerns

The Federal Reserve decided to move more cautiously on interest rate cuts due to uncertainties from President-elect Trump's policies, despite previous aggressive cuts.

#### Focusing Facts

- The Fed's benchmark borrowing rate was set to a range of 4.25%-4.5% following a full point reduction in 2024.

- Fed's December 2025 projections reduced expected rate cuts from four to two for that year, reflecting adjustment in outlook.

- Core inflation ran at 2.8% in November 2024, exceeding the Fed's 2% annual target.

| Investors and Financial Markets | Investors are anticipating limited rate cuts in 2025 with market prices reflecting a wait-and-see approach, especially in view of potential trade policy changes under Trump's administration. | Financial markets have a vested interest in stable, predictable policy changes as they affect investment returns and market volatility; thus, they may prefer policies that promise stability and predictability. | [Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-today-interest-rates-inflation-outlook-fed-rate-cuts-2025-1) [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/08/federal-reserve-inflation-trump) |
| Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Other Hawkish Fed Members | Governor Bowman and other hawkish members believe inflation remains above the Fed's target and advocate for a more restrained approach to rate cuts, viewing recent inflation declines as insufficient. | Hawkish members typically hold a financial conservative stance preferring higher interest rates to control inflation, which could bias them towards prioritizing inflation control over growth stimulation. | [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/09/fed-governor-bowman-says-december-interest-rate-cut-should-be-the-last.html) |

#### Context

Historically, presidents influencing or attempting to influence the Federal Reserve can be traced back to examples like Richard Nixon, who reportedly pressured the Fed for political gain during the 1972 elections. Trump's policies, reminiscent of protectionist measures, signal a divergence from the global economic integration trend that dominated post-Cold War economics, presenting a pivot point in American economic policy comparable to the shifts seen in the 1930s pre-WWII era. With a history of tension between presidential ambitions and Fed's autonomy, this moment echoes past struggles over economic independence but reflects ongoing shifts towards nationalism and economic protectionism, which could have ramifications for global market dynamics, trade relations, and inflation trends.
