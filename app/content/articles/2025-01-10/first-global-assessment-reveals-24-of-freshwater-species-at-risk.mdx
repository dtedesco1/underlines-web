# First Global Assessment Reveals 24% of Freshwater Species at Risk

The inaugural global assessment indicates that 24% of freshwater species face extinction, threatened by pollution, invasive species, and habitat disruptions.

#### Focusing Facts

- The study evaluated the risk of extinction for 23,496 freshwater species.

- Freshwater ecosystems, despite covering less than 1% of Earth's surface, support over 10% of all known species.

- About 35% of wetlands have been lost between 1970 and 2015.


#### Narrow Perspectives

| Group | General Perspective | Possible Bias | Sources |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| IUCN Freshwater Biodiversity Scientists | The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) scientists believe that freshwater ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots that require distinct management strategies due to prevalent threats like pollution, dams, and invasive species, and that a failure to address these issues could severely impact biodiversity and human welfare. | The IUCN scientists' perspectives may be influenced by their mission to conserve biodiversity globally, potentially emphasizing findings that align with their conservation goals. | [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08375-z) [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/first-ever-multi-taxon-global-freshwater-fauna-assessment-identifies-western-ghats-as-a-hotspot-of-threatened-species/article69076585.ece) |
| Freshwater Ecologists | Freshwater ecologists argue that the widespread threat to freshwater species has been underappreciated and that comprehensive data assessment should spur action to protect these ecosystems as they are pivotal for biodiversity and human well-being. | Ecologists might prioritize biodiversity data and its implications due to their professional focus and reliance on data-driven conservation efforts, potentially leading to an emphasis on acquiring new data to fill gaps. | [The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/a-quarter-of-freshwater-animals-threatened-with-extinction-finds-major-new-study-246848) |
| Conservation Organizations | Conservation organizations emphasize the urgency of integrated water management to curb biodiversity loss, highlighting the critical ecological roles that freshwater species play in maintaining global biodiversity and ecosystem services. | Conservation organizations may focus on providing dramatic narratives to attract public and donor support for urgent action on biodiversity conservation, which may influence their framing of the threats and solutions. | [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-a-quarter-of-freshwater-animals-are-threatened-with-extinction-new/) [Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/2de7e5de-b677-441f-b91c-97014e940684) |
| Academic Researchers | Academic researchers highlight the technical aspects of threats to freshwater biodiversity, emphasizing the detailed analysis required to understand the complex interplay of factors contributing to extinctions, such as land use changes and climate change impacts. | As researchers focused on scientific and empirical evidence, they may emphasize complex technical processes and data analysis, potentially overlooking simpler communication that may engage broader audiences. | [Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14265109/Nearly-one-four-freshwater-fish-species-crustaceans-dragonflies-high-risk-extinction-scientists-warn.html) [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/worlds-freshwater-species-facing-extinction-25-under-extreme-threat-2662032-2025-01-09) |

#### Context

1. Historical Analogy: The current threat to freshwater species mirrors the early 20th-century biodiversity crises in terrestrial and marine environments, where late policy interventions led to significant species loss. The Dust Bowl (1930s) and Great Plains plow-up are analogs in terms of ecological impact and mismanagement of the environment. 2. Long-Term Trends: This event highlights the continuous impact of anthropogenic activities—such as agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization—on global biodiversity. Freshwater ecosystems' vulnerability is underlined as they suffer the consequences of fragmented policy and oversight solely focused on terrestrial habitats, although they play a critical role in carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. 3. Significance: This moment represents a critical juncture for biodiversity conservation efforts, as it exposes the urgent need to synthesize conservation policies that equally recognize freshwater environments alongside terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Ignoring this would further exacerbate declines, much like the historical species losses observed in other neglected ecosystems. The event underscores a global recognition for integrative management approaches, highlighting freshwater ecosystems as crucial reservoirs of biodiversity and elements of ecological resilience upon which both global environmental health and human economies depend.
