#### Narrow Perspectives

|--------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Hezbollah and Amal Movement | They are maneuvering to find a presidential candidate that is less divisive but still accommodates their interests, given their weakened position after the recent conflict and changes in regional power dynamics. | Hezbollah and Amal are likely biased towards maintaining their political influence and safeguarding their interests in Lebanon, including the ceasefire terms and international relations. | [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxzxd32lzvo) [Asharq Al-Awsat English](https://english.aawsat.com/node/5099296) |
| US and Saudi-backed Lebanese factions | They support Joseph Aoun's candidacy as a strategic move to stabilize Lebanon politically and economically, leveraging his US ties to execute much-needed reforms and secure foreign funding. | Their bias stems from a strategic interest in diminishing Iranian influence and bolstering a pro-Western political alignment in Lebanon. | [CNN International](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/middleeast/joseph-aoun-elected-lebanon-president-intl/index.html) [Arab News](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2585758/middle-east) |
| Lebanese Economic Reform Advocates | They see the election as a vital step towards governmental reforms necessary for international financial aid and economic recovery, particularly after the severe financial crisis post-2019. | Their bias may revolve around prioritizing economic policies and international relations that favor rapid economic improvements over other political concerns. | [France 24](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250109-lebanon-set-to-elect-president-after-12-failed-bids-joseph-aoun-emerges-as-frontrunner) [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/01/09/lebanon-president-joseph-aoun-hezbollah-parliament/) |
| Lebanese Maronite Christian Community | Their perspective on the presidential election is deeply tied to the role of the presidency in protecting their community's political power within Lebanon's sectarian balance. | The community's bias lies in ensuring the elected president is a Maronite Christian who can effectively uphold the sectarian power-sharing system. | [Asharq Al-Awsat English](https://english.aawsat.com/node/5099296) [Asharq Al-Awsat English](https://english.aawsat.com/node/5099298) |

#### Context

This election marks a historic moment as it ends the longest presidential vacancy since the end of Lebanon's civil war and comes after 12 unsuccessful attempts. The context of Joseph Aoun's election bears resemblance to Emile Lahoud's presidency in 1998 when military figures took office post-political paralysis, reflecting Lebanon's recurrent reliance on military leadership. This event occurred amidst Hezbollah's weakened state after its conflict with Israel and the toppling of its ally Bashar al-Assad, showcasing a significant shift in regional power dynamics, potentially reducing Iranian influence in Lebanon. It is critical as it might unlock foreign aid and support needed for Lebanon's reconstruction post-economic crisis and align Lebanon more closely with Western powers, especially following U.S. and Saudi backing of Aoun. The presidency could either be a stepping stone towards reform or repeat past cycles of deadlock depending on Aoun's ability to navigate Lebanon's delicate sectarian and political landscapes.
