# Ukraine Ends Gas Transit Contract with Russia, Shifts to U.S. LNG

Ukraine ended its gas transit deal with Russia, redirecting to U.S. LNG supplies, affecting EU energy dynamics.

#### Focusing Facts

- Ukraine's refusal to renew the transit deal halted Russian gas via Ukraine as of January 1, impacting several EU countries.

- First U.S. LNG shipment to Ukraine occurred weeks before Trump's 2025 inauguration amid a cold winter forecast.

- Natural gas prices in EU rose to €50 per MWh following Ukraine's decision, the highest since October 2023.


#### Narrow Perspectives

| Group | General Perspective | Possible Bias | Sources |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Ukrainian Government | Ukraine views the shift from Russian to U.S. gas as a strategic move towards energy independence and strengthening ties with the U.S. amid ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia. | Ukraine's view is influenced by its need to reduce dependence on Russian energy supplies and to secure political and economic support from Western allies. | [HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ukraine-us-lng_n_677d6c01e4b07acf439cd871) [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-switches-russian-u-gas-204649230.html) |
| Hungarian Government | The Hungarian Government blames Ukraine's halt of Russian gas transit for increasing natural gas prices in Europe, arguing that the decision disrupts regional energy stability and burdens EU citizens financially. | Hungary's view may be affected by its previous energy dependence on Russian gas and political relations with both the EU and Russia. | [RT](https://www.rt.com/news/610558-eu-ukraine-hungary-gas/) |
| German Politicians Opposing Current Energy Policy | Some German politicians argue that reactivating the Nord Stream pipelines is crucial for Germany's industrial survival and economic stability amidst the energy crisis caused by halted Russian gas flows. | This perspective is influenced by economic pressures from rising energy costs and industrial needs, as well as political stances on energy policy. | [NaturalNews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-01-07-german-lawmaker-urges-reactivation-of-nord-stream-pipelines.html) |

#### Context

The geopolitical shift recalls Ukraine’s Orange Revolution of 2004, affecting its energy dependencies, and mirrors Germany's post-Fukushima pivot from nuclear to renewable energy in 2011. Historically, European reliance on Russian gas stems from 1970s Cold War pipelines, but disruptions post-2014 Crimea annexation warned the EU. As in 1973's oil crisis, today's supply upheaval fosters energy diversification. Future EU gas strategies, informed by the 2006 Russian-Ukraine gas disputes, might prioritize LNG, as Europe builds infrastructure akin to the 1900s coal transition. This moment echoes Cold War energy politics' economic impacts, showing a modern 'energy Iron Curtain.' Long-term trends include U.S. energy market leadership, reshaping EU-Russian energy ties, and reinforcing NATO energy security discussions. Europe's shift from Russian gas might parallel post-1970s oil independence endeavors, forecasting higher initial prices, potential supply fragility, yet eventual market stabilization if resilience models succeed.
