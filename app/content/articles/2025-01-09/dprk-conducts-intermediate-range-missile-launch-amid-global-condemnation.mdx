#### Context

North Korea's missile activities mirror past nuclear arms races such as the Cold War's arms policies between the US and USSR in the mid-20th century. This launch reflects a continuing pattern seen since the DPRK's first nuclear test in 2006, as it challenges international non-proliferation norms set by the NPT of 1968. The event underscores the fractured geopolitical environment, similar to tensions heightened by the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Given DPRK's historical pattern of nuclear advancements (as seen in 2012 with their 'satellite' launch that many considered a ballistic test), these activities further isolate DPRK economically and politically, similar to past sanctions. The situation emphasizes the difficulty in achieving denuclearization, suggesting ongoing tension akin to DPRK's missile tests during US political transitions, indicating possible future provocations coinciding with international political events.
