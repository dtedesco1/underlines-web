#### Narrow Perspectives

|--------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Bitcoin Enthusiasts | Bitcoin enthusiasts view the cryptocurrency hitting $100K as just a milestone in their larger vision to ultimately surpass gold's market cap, with campaigns like #PicFlipTillGoldFlip fostering community engagement and the idea that Bitcoin's digital asset superiority is inevitable. | The bias stems from a cultural allegiance to Bitcoin as a revolutionary financial technology and a skepticism of traditional financial systems. | [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/from-laser-eyes-to-upside-down-pics-the-new-bitcoin-campaign-to-flip-gold) [Bitcoinist.com](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-joins-top-10-global-assets-claiming-the-7th-spot-report/) |
| Institutional Investors | Institutional investors now see Bitcoin as a credible asset class, evidenced by record inflows into Bitcoin ETFs that make investment easier for big institutions adapting to the old finance world. | Their vested financial interest in Bitcoin and its potential returns influence their optimistic outlook, and institutional validation also spurs financial gains for those involved early. | [Bitcoinist.com](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-joins-top-10-global-assets-claiming-the-7th-spot-report/) [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/01/07/happy-new-year-bitcoin/) |

#### Context

The quest for Bitcoin to topple gold as a paramount store of value echoes historical shifts in financial paradigms, such as the transition from the gold standard post-Bretton Woods in 1971 and the rise of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency in the mid-20th century. Each marked a formidable shift from traditional to contemporary economic symbols. Bitcoin's rally reflects a broader trend towards digitalization, reminiscent of the internet's impact on communication in the late 20th century. The formation of digital assets as credible investment vehicles also harks back to the dot-com boom of the 1990s. What makes this moment vital is Bitcoin's mainstream adoption as an investment class, evident through corporate treasuries and ETF inclusions, much like the crowning of paper money as a standard over precious metals. If history is prescient, just as past technological and financial shifts brought greater liquidity and economic integration, Bitcoin's ascension could lead to further shifts in global finance, challenging existing norms and generating opportunities for digital economies.
