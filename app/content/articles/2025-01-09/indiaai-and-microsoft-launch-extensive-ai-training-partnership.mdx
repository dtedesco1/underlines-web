#### Context

Historically, collaborations to advance technology education have led to significant national competitiveness boosts; notable examples include South Korea's investment in ICT education in the 2000s and Germany’s dual education system reforms in 2005. The partnership reflects India’s long-term digital transformation goals, reminiscent of its Digital India initiative launched in 2015 to universalize digital access. This moment is crucial for India's tech sector, potentially placing it on par with global AI leaders like the USA and China. Similar upskilling initiatives in China, with its AI plan of 2017, suggest this could strengthen India’s position in the digital economy and foster long-term economic growth.
