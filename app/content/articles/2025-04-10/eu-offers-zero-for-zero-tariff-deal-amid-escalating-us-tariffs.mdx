# EU Offers Zero-for-Zero Tariff Deal Amid Escalating US Tariffs

On April 7, 2025, as U.S. tariffs on over €380 billion of EU industrial goods intensify, the EU proposed a 'zero-for-zero' deal to eliminate tariffs, signaling its willingness to negotiate while preparing retaliatory measures.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump imposed a baseline 20% tariff (with a separate 25% rate for steel, aluminum, and cars) on EU imports effective from April 9, affecting 70% of EU exports.

- EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the zero-for-zero tariff offer on April 7, with retaliatory measures scheduled to begin on April 15 and expand on May 15.

- EU trade figures estimate potential duties rising from €7 billion to over €80 billion if the tariffs persist.

#### Context

This episode echoes historical trade disputes such as the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which intensified global economic tensions, though today’s interconnected supply chains provide more levers for negotiation. The event reflects long-term trends in protectionism and the recalibration of global trading alliances. Over a 100‐year horizon, such tariff escalations and countermeasures, while disruptive in the short term, typically lead to structural shifts—like diversifying markets or renegotiating trade partnerships—that reshape economic systems rather than permanently destabilize them.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European official/media**: These sources present the EU offer as a diplomatic move aimed at averting a full-scale trade war through negotiation and measured retaliation. They emphasize the EU’s unity and readiness to negotiate, possibly downplaying contrary economic impacts or internal divisions in favor of a cohesive EU stance.

- **US right-leaning media**: These outlets portray the EU offer as a yielding position to President Trump’s aggressive trade policies, framing it as a capitulation that reinforces U.S. economic strength. They tend to sensationalize the narrative of American dominance while casting EU maneuvers as reactive and overly conciliatory, serving political messaging rather than nuanced analysis.
