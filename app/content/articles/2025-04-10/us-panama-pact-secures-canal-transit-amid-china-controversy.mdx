# US-Panama Pact Secures Canal Transit Amid China Controversy

In April 2025, US and Panamanian officials inked a security accord promising toll-free, 'first and free' passage for US warships to counter alleged Chinese influence around the Panama Canal.

#### Focusing Facts

- A memorandum of understanding was signed establishing a cost-neutral mechanism for US warship transit.

- Panamanian President Mulino publicly denied any Chinese control, even as audits revealed contract breaches by the Hong Kong consortium.

- Multiple US military assets, including the USNS Comfort and guided missile cruisers, have been deployed for joint drills with Panama.

#### Context

The security pact echoes historical tensions over control of critical chokepoints, reminiscent of US interventions during the Cold War and the strategic recalibrations following the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty. This modern alignment, driven by US claims of Chinese espionage and economic leverage, reflects longstanding global power dynamics where control over vital trade routes has repeatedly sparked rivalries. Over a century, such realignments have shaped the geopolitical orderâ€”this event may either fortify a cooperative security framework or escalate regional tensions, contingent on how notions of sovereignty and neutrality evolve in a multipolar world.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning media**: These outlets portray US actions in Panama as a robust effort to secure the canal by countering Chinese influence and protecting American national security, echoing Trump-era assertions. They tend to emphasize aggressive national security measures and often frame China as a clear threat, potentially overstating risks to justify military and political interventions.

- **Left-leaning and diplomatic outlets**: These sources highlight Chinese diplomatic backlash and critique US rhetoric, arguing that the narrative of a Chinese threat is sensationalized and interferes with Panamanian sovereignty. They may underplay legitimate security concerns to focus on the US overreach and to promote a view of international cooperation over unilateral action.
