# EU Enacts Phased Tariff Retaliation Against U.S. Metals Tariffs

On April 9, the EU member states approved a multi-stage counter-tariff package targeting over €20 billion in U.S. imports in response to Trump's 25% tariffs on European steel and aluminum.

#### Focusing Facts

- EU tariffs of 25% will hit roughly €22 billion of U.S. products in three phases starting April 15, May 16, and December 1.

- The measures, approved by nearly all 27 member states (with Hungary dissenting), target a broad list excluding sensitive items like bourbon, wine, and dairy.

- The EU is preparing a second package of retaliatory measures while keeping the door open for suspension if negotiations yield a balanced outcome.

#### Context

This development is reminiscent of past tariff escalations such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which contributed to a deepening global recession. The EU’s tactical, phased approach signals not only a short-term response to retaliate against U.S. protectionism but also reflects long-term trends of rising global trade tensions and economic nationalism. Over the next century, such reciprocal measures may continue to shape the balance in international trade policy, affecting global economic integration and prompting renewed calls for multilateral negotiation frameworks.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International mainstream media**: These outlets report the EU’s tariffs as a measured, defensive response to what they label as unjustified U.S. tariffs, emphasizing the bloc’s preference for negotiations and a balanced outcome. They tend to portray the EU actions as principled and economically reasonable, possibly underplaying any internal dissent or negative consequences of escalating trade tensions.

- **US conservative media**: These sources stress the retaliatory nature of the EU's countermeasures and highlight U.S. political figures’ perspectives, framing the actions as part of a broader trade conflict initiated by Trump’s policies. They may amplify Trump's rhetoric and suggest that EU measures are overly aggressive or damaging, reflecting a tendency to view U.S. interests as paramount.
