#### Context

Historically, technological monopolies, like IBM in the 1960s with mainframes, have eventually faced antitrust scrutiny, shaping industry landscapes. Nvidia's dominance in AI chips reflects broader monopolistic trends within tech, similar to Microsoft's Windows dominance in the 1990s. This moment signifies potential regulatory challenges, specifically with ongoing investigations by U.S. and Chinese authorities into Nvidia's market practices, amidst global tensions and tech wars. While Nvidia's growth showcases the AI sector's parallels to the early days of semiconductor growth in the late 20th century, the unforeseen consequences of such market dominance could reshape competitive landscapes and regulatory standards globally.
