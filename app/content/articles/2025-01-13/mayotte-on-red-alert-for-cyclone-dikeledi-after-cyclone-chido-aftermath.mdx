#### Context

Historically, the impacts of tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean have often been devastating, as seen with the 2019 Cyclone Idai, which killed over 1,500 people across southern Africa. Mayotte, as France's poorest overseas department with a dense and vulnerable population, becomes critically exposed in such cyclical natural hazards. The repeated battering of the island, first by Chido and now Dikeledi, underscores the escalating weather volatility due to climate change and the infrastructural vulnerabilities in post-colonial outposts like Mayotte. This event highlights the ongoing struggle of small island territories to sustainably manage disaster risk and long-term rebuilding amidst socio-economic inequities and strained political ties with governing nations. The event is significant as it could foster increased awareness and action towards integrating modern, climate-resilient infrastructure and policies to safeguard these regions.
