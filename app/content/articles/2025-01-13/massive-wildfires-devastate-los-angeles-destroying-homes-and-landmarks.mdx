#### Context

Historically, California has faced devastating wildfires, such as the 2018 Camp Fire, which destroyed over 13,000 buildings and resulted in 85 deaths. The recurrence of such fires is linked to climate change-induced droughts and severe winds, indicative of a pattern of extreme weather. This particular event highlights the challenges posed by urban expansion into historically fire-prone regions, showing increased vulnerability to natural disasters. The approved major disaster declaration marks federal recognition of the severity, akin to prior interventions. These fires continue to shape urban policy, emergency preparedness, and climate adaptation strategies in California.
