# U.S. Imposes New Sanctions Heavily Impacting Russian Oil Exports

On January 10, 2025, the U.S. imposed new sanctions targeting Russia's oil industry, leading Brent crude to surpass $80 a barrel for the first time since October 2024.

#### Focusing Facts

- Sanctions targeted 183 vessels and key Russian oil firms Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas.

- As a direct consequence, India's Russian crude imports were threatened, with 36% of its total imports coming from Russia over the past year.

- Extreme cold in the Northern Hemisphere has increased demand for heating fuels, further driving oil prices up.

#### Context

Historical parallels exist with sanctions imposed on Iran's oil industry, such as those implemented in 2012, which similarly aimed to cripple an adversary's key revenue source. These recent U.S. sanctions on Russia reflect a broader trend of economic warfare in geopolitics, challenging traditional supply chains and pushing global markets to adapt. The shift signifies a potential realignment of energy markets, prompting China and India to diversify supply sources amidst rising geopolitical tensions. This moment is pivotal as it underscores the fragile balance in energy dependence and global diplomacy, potentially marking a shift in energy trade dynamics post-pandemic.
