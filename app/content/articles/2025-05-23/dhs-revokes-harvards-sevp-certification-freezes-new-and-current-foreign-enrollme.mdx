# DHS Revokes Harvard’s SEVP Certification, Freezes New and Current Foreign Enrollment

On 22 May 2025 the Department of Homeland Security abruptly yanked Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, instantly stripping the school of the legal ability to enroll — or even retain — international students.

On 22 May 2025 the Department of Homeland Security abruptly yanked Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, instantly stripping the school of the legal ability to enroll — or even retain — international students.

#### Focusing Facts

- Kristi Noem’s letter dated 22 May 2025 terminates Harvard’s SEVP access “effective immediately,” forcing ~7,000 existing foreign students to transfer or face deportation.

- Homeland Security gave Harvard 72 hours to surrender five years of disciplinary and protest-related records for all visa-holding students as a condition for reinstatement.

- The Trump administration has already frozen roughly $3 billion in federal research funds and threatened Harvard’s tax-exempt status in the same standoff.

#### Context

Washington’s use of immigration levers to discipline universities echoes the 1950-54 McCarthy-era loyalty oath crusades that cost Berkeley its faculty and saw foreign scholars denied visas. Like the post-9/11 SEVIS rollout (2003) that tethered student status to national-security databases, this move weaponises bureaucratic minutiae to advance a broader culture-war agenda—here, forcing campuses to police speech on Israel, curtail DEI programmes and share surveillance data. Over the long arc, the episode spotlights two converging trends: the executive branch’s growing willingness to bypass Congress by exploiting discretionary immigration powers, and the fracturing of the post-1945 consensus that universities serve as semi-autonomous global commons. Whether the revocation survives court challenges or is reversed by a future administration, it plants a precedent: federal certification—and thus the international character of U.S. higher education—can be switched off like a light. In a century’s view, such precedents could either normalise political litmus tests for academia or, if rebuked, reinforce judicial limits on executive overreach.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning US and UK outlets (e.g., The New York Times, Washington Post, BBC, The Guardian, POLITICO)**: Portray the visa revocation as a retaliatory escalation by the Trump administration that jeopardises thousands of students and academic freedom at Harvard. Coverage stresses harm to immigrants and free inquiry while largely sidelining the administration’s stated antisemitism concerns, reflecting these outlets’ frequent skepticism toward Trump-era enforcement actions. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/22/trump-harvard-international-students-enrollment-revoked/), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05768jmm11o?xtor=AL-72-%255Bpartner%255D-%255Binforadio%255D-%255Bheadline%255D-%255Bnews%255D-%255Bbizdev%255D-%255Bisapi%255D))

- **Right-leaning media (Fox News)**: Frames the move as justified enforcement against Harvard’s "pro-terrorist" campus climate and refusal to share disciplinary records, applauding the administration for protecting Jewish students and upholding the law. Accepts Homeland Security’s accusations at face value, employing loaded language about "racist DEI" and offering scant scrutiny of due-process implications or the policy’s sweep over innocent students.

- **Business-focused financial press (CNBC, Financial Times)**: Reports the action chiefly as a material setback for Harvard—highlighting lost tuition revenue, frozen research funding and investor-relevant ramifications—while noting the wider clash with the administration. Market-centric framing can underplay the humanitarian or civil-liberties stakes, treating thousands of students and academic norms as secondary to financial impact and institutional risk.
