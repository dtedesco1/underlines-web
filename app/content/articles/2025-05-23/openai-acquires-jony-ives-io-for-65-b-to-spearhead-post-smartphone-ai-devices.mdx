# OpenAI Acquires Jony Ive’s io for $6.5 B to Spearhead Post-Smartphone AI Devices

OpenAI struck an all-equity, roughly $6.5 billion deal to buy io, the year-old hardware startup founded by former Apple design chief Jony Ive, installing him as head of design to create a new family of AI-first consumer devices.

#### Focusing Facts

- The transaction—OpenAI’s largest ever—values io at $6.5 billion and folds its 55-person team into an internal hardware division reporting to VP Peter Welinder.

- Ive’s design firm LoveFrom stays independent, but he will assume “deep design and creative responsibilities” across all OpenAI products.

- OpenAI already owned a 23 % stake in io before the buyout, reducing the cash/stock outlay to about $5 billion.

#### Context

Big software players have often bought hardware talent to catalyze paradigm shifts: Google’s 2005 $50 m purchase of Android set up the mobile era, while Apple’s 1996 $429 m NeXT deal returned Steve Jobs and birthed the iPhone in 2007.  Altman’s move echoes those bets—pairing a fast-growing platform with a celebrated designer to control the end-to-end user experience.  It also fits a longer trend toward vertical integration whenever a new computing platform (PCs in the 1980s, smartphones in the 2000s, VR/AR in the 2010s) crystallizes.  Whether AI assistants escape the app sandbox and gain their own ubiquitous form factor will shape data capture, privacy regimes, and the balance of power between incumbent phone makers and AI labs for decades.  If OpenAI succeeds, 2025 could read like 1977’s Apple II launch or 2007’s iPhone reveal—a hinge that reorganizes how billions interact with computers; if it fails, it may join 2013’s Google Glass and 2024’s Humane Pin as another costly near-miss.  Either outcome will inform how society absorbs AI over the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business and financial press (Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, Financial Times, CNBC)**: Presents the $6.5 billion acquisition as a bold, strategic play that positions OpenAI to disrupt smartphone incumbents and unlock huge new revenue streams. By catering to investors and the tech-market audience, coverage accentuates growth upside and competitive stakes while glossing over execution risk, prior AI-gadget failures, and broader social concerns.

- **Center-left general-interest outlets (The Atlantic, The New York Times)**: Highlight OpenAI’s sweeping ambition but stress that no real product exists yet, warning the move could be more hype than substance and could further entrench Big Tech power. Their tradition of scrutinising corporate power leads them to foreground pitfalls and lock-in dangers, potentially understating commercial potential or investor logic.

- **Public-service broadcaster coverage (BBC)**: Frames the deal mainly through Sir Jony Ive’s celebrated design legacy and what it means for Apple, noting market reactions and Britain’s design pedigree. Aiming for broad neutrality, the reporting still leans on national pride in a famous British figure and avoids deep critique of OpenAI’s motives or financial stakes.
