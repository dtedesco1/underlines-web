# Global Long-Bond Rout After U.S. Downgrade and Trump Tax Bill Push 30-Year Treasury Above 5%

Within 72 hours of Moody’s cutting U.S. sovereign credit and the House passing President Trump’s multi-trillion-dollar tax-cut bill, investors dumped long-dated government bonds worldwide, driving the U.S. 30-year yield to a 17-year high above 5% and sparking parallel spikes in Japanese and German yields.

#### Focusing Facts

- U.S. 30-year Treasury yield hit 5.12% intraday on 22 May 2025, its first break above 5% since 2007.

- Moody’s stripped the U.S. of its last AAA rating on 16 May 2025, citing debt projected to reach 134% of GDP within a decade.

- The 20-year Treasury’s $16 billion auction on 21 May cleared at 5.05% with the weakest foreign take-up (58.9%) since 2019.

#### Context

Bond vigilantes have appeared before—1994’s market revolt that forced the Clinton administration to abandon spending plans, or S&P’s 2011 U.S. downgrade that briefly shocked but soon faded—yet this episode lands after a decade of near-zero rates and COVID-era debt explosions. With global public debt at record highs, central banks retreating from quantitative easing, and demographics slowing growth, the term-premium repricing echoes the 1970s’ stagflation surge when U.S. 10-year premiums exceeded 5%. Unlike past scares, this time Japan and Germany, long safe-harbours, are also seeing record long-end yields, hinting at a systemic shift: investors now demand higher compensation for holding any rich-world sovereign paper. If sustained, the shift could reset fiscal math for decades, forcing choices on taxation, spending and social contracts that have been deferred since the 1980s debt super-cycle—an inflection point that may define public finance for the next century rather than a mere market hiccup.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The Hill)**: Portrays the bond-market turmoil as a direct consequence of GOP deficit-expanding tax cuts that threaten social programs and rattle global investors. Emphasizes Republican responsibility and social-welfare fallout while downplaying how earlier bipartisan spending and trade shocks also swelled the debt. ([The Hill](https://thehill.com/business/5314151-gop-bill-markets-shock/))

- **Right leaning media (e.g., Fox Business)**: Warns that surging Treasury yields and stock losses stem from uncertainty around Trump’s tax bill but spotlights the dangers of overall government spending and debt. Frames the sell-off largely as market jitters rather than a verdict on the wisdom of big tax cuts, implicitly soft-pedaling criticism of Trump while faulting ‘government’ more broadly.

- **Global financial news agencies (e.g., Reuters, CNBC, Yahoo Finance, Investing.com)**: See a worldwide repricing of long-dated sovereign debt as investors demand higher term premia amid ballooning U.S. deficits, Moody’s downgrade and similar fiscal strains in Japan and Europe. Rely on market strategists whose livelihood depends on trading volatility, sometimes accentuating worst-case scenarios to keep readers focused on immediate market risks.
