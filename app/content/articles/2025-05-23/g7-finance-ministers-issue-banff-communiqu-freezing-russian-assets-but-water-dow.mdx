# G7 Finance Ministers Issue Banff Communiqué Freezing Russian Assets but Water Down War Condemnation

On 23 May 2025 the G7 finance ministers in Banff, Canada agreed to keep roughly $280 bn in Russian sovereign assets frozen and threatened extra sanctions if no ceasefire, yet—after U.S. objections—the final text dropped a pledge of “further support” for Kyiv and avoided calling Russia’s invasion “illegal.”

#### Focusing Facts

- Communiqué clause 10 states Russian sovereign assets in G7 jurisdictions will remain immobilised until Moscow ends its aggression and pays for war damage.

- U.S. negotiators struck language promising continued aid to Ukraine and removed the word “illegal,” softening the October 2024 G7 wording.

- A proposal to cut the Russian oil price cap from $60 to $50 a barrel was debated but shelved after U.S. resistance.

#### Context

Allies publicly sanctioning a great-power aggressor while haggling over rhetoric recalls the League of Nations’ 1935 sanctions on Italy—strong in headline, porous in detail—and shows enduring limits of coalition discipline.  Since 2014 the West has escalated from individual visa bans to unprecedented seizure of a G-20 member’s central-bank reserves, extending a 50-year trend of weaponising the dollar system that began with the 1979 Iran freeze.  Yet the intra-G7 split mirrors earlier moments—like the 2003 Iraq War rift—when U.S. policy veered from European consensus, signalling to Moscow and Beijing that Western unity is negotiable.  Over a century these precedents matter less for immediate battlefield outcomes than for codifying a new norm: sovereign reserves can be held hostage to behavior.  Whether future powers view this as deterrence or reason to de-dollarise will shape the financial order well beyond the Ukraine war’s eventual settlement.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Ukrainian national media (Ukrinform, Українська правда, Interfax-Ukraine)**: Portray the G7 communiqué as a strong reaffirmation of unwavering Western support for Kyiv, highlighting the decision to keep Russian assets frozen until Moscow pays reparations and the pledge to continue pressure if a ceasefire is not reached. Writing for a domestic audience at war, these outlets accentuate supportive language and avoid dwelling on U.S. resistance to tougher wording, bolstering morale and the image of an intact pro-Ukraine coalition.

- **Russian state-owned media (TASS)**: Frames the summit around Washington’s objection to including ‘further support’ for Kyiv and to calling the invasion ‘illegal,’ suggesting a softening Western stance. By labeling the war a ‘special military operation’ and spotlighting U.S. pushback, the outlet seeks to depict dwindling backing for Ukraine and legitimacy for Moscow’s position.

- **Liberal/left-leaning international outlets (The Guardian, Al Jazeera, Meduza)**: Emphasize that the final G7 wording is weaker than previous statements because President Trump has diluted support, while noting ongoing allied debates over measures like the oil price cap. Their focus on intra-G7 friction and Trump’s role underscores skepticism toward his foreign policy, potentially overstating division compared with the communiqué’s consensus on aid and sanctions.
