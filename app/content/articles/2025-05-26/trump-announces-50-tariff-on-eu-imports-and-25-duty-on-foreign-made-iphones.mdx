# Trump Announces 50% Tariff on EU Imports and 25% Duty on Foreign-Made iPhones

In a pair of 23 May 2025 Truth Social posts, President Trump said all European Union goods will face a 50 % import tariff from 1 June and warned Apple that iPhones assembled outside the U.S. will be hit with a 25 % levy, scrapping the 90-day tariff pause agreed in April.

#### Focusing Facts

- The 50 % EU tariff is slated to take effect 1 June 2025, raising the bloc’s current baseline rate from 10 % to five times that level.

- Within hours of the posts, S&P 500 futures fell 1.5 % and Europe’s Stoxx 600 dropped 1.7 %, while Apple shares slid roughly 3 %.

- EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič readied up to $108 billion in retaliatory duties and publicly insisted negotiations be guided by "mutual respect."

#### Context

Trade shocks launched by sitting U.S. presidents are not new—Herbert Hoover’s 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act raised average U.S. tariffs to 40 %, triggering a spiral of reprisals that deepened the Great Depression—yet few have been rolled out as abruptly or communicated by social-media decree.  Trump’s threat fits a longer drift since the 1971 Nixon surcharge and the 2018–19 tariff rounds toward using unilateral duties as everyday leverage, eroding post-1947 rules that channeled disputes through the GATT/WTO.  If enforced, a 50 % tariff on the world’s second-largest economic bloc could accelerate the fragmentation of supply chains, push Europe closer to China in search of alternative markets, and encourage firms like Apple to split production footprints—effects that could echo for decades, much as Smoot-Hawley reshaped global tariff ceilings for half a century.  Conversely, should the threat fizzle—as many of Trump’s earlier escalations did—the episode will reinforce a perception that U.S. trade policy is volatile and leader-driven, a reputation that, over a 100-year horizon, may matter as much as any single tariff rate.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The Guardian, NPR)**: Cast Trump’s 50% EU tariff threat as an alarming escalation driven by erratic negotiating tactics that risks recession and market turmoil. Coverage centers heavily on the economic downside and Trump’s unpredictability, reinforcing a critical narrative while giving scant attention to arguments about trade imbalances or on-shoring jobs. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/23/trump-eu-tariff-us-trade-talks), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/23/nx-s1-5408573/trump-tariffs-eu-apple-iphones))

- **Right leaning media (e.g., Fox Business)**: Frames the tariff threats as a hard-nosed ‘America First’ bargaining tool meant to force Apple to reshore manufacturing and push the E.U. toward fairer trade terms. Reporting largely echoes White House talking points, minimising possible consumer price hikes or retaliation and portraying the move as savvy leverage rather than risky brinkmanship.

- **European-focused public broadcasters (e.g., BBC)**: Highlight European officials’ call for negotiations based on mutual 'respect' and signal readiness to defend E.U. interests against what they characterise as U.S. threats. Stories foreground the E.U.’s diplomatic posture and depict Washington as the provocateur, giving limited scrutiny to Brussels’ own barriers that the U.S. criticises.
