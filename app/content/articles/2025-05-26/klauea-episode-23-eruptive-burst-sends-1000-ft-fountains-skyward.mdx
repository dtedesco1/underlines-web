# Kīlauea Episode 23 Eruptive Burst Sends 1,000-ft Fountains Skyward

After three days of subdued inflation, Kīlauea’s Halemaʻumaʻu crater flipped from recharge to eruption at 4:15 p.m. HST on 25 May 2025, unleashing Episode 23’s sustained lava fountains.

#### Focusing Facts

- North-vent fountains topped ~300 m (>1,000 ft) by 4:50 p.m., while the south vent reached ~70 m (230 ft).

- Real-time SO₂ output spiked from ~1,200 t/d during the pause to roughly 50,000 t/d once fountaining began.

- Uēkahuna tiltmeter logged ~12 µrad of summit inflation since 16 May before abruptly switching to deflation at eruption onset.

#### Context

Kīlauea’s stop-start style recalls the 1983–86 opening years of the Puʻu ʻŌʻō eruption when 44 episodic fountains punctuated months of tilt cycling, and even earlier the 1959 Kīlauea Iki event that shot 580 m jets skyward. The present pattern—rapid pressurization, brief high-lava bursts, gas-rich plumes, then repose—signals a shallow, well-plumbed summit system whose pressure valves now open and shut on a matter-of-days cadence. Over a century horizon, these pulses matter less for acreage buried (flows are trapped in the crater) than for the volatile budget released into the Pacific atmosphere and for clues about whether magma is once again migrating toward the historically destructive East Rift. Each inflation-deflation loop is effectively a stress test on caldera faults; history shows (e.g., 1975’s M 7.7 Kalapana quake) that repeated pressurization can culminate in flank slip and large seismic events. So while Episode 23 is visually spectacular but presently contained, it is another tiny tick in the long ledger of how Kīlauea redistributes magma, gas, and crustal strain—processes that will shape both Hawaiian land and hazard maps well beyond the current media cycle.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **U.S. government scientific agency (USGS / Hawaiian Volcano Observatory)**: Frames Episode 23 chiefly as a monitored, episodic phase of Kīlauea’s summit eruption, stressing changing tilt data, gas output and potential hazards while noting activity remains confined to the national park. Because its mandate is public safety and authoritative reporting, the agency foregrounds technical detail and may consciously tamp down dramatic language so as not to incite panic or encourage thrill-seeking tourism.

- **Local Hawaiian broadcast news (KHON2)**: Highlights the spectacular sight of lava fountains "over 1,000 feet" and invokes Pele mythology to portray the eruption as a powerful visual event for viewers. Seeking audience engagement, the station accentuates the drama and cultural imagery of the eruption and gives scant attention to the scientific uncertainty or health hazards underscored by officials.

- **International business-oriented mainstream media (The Economic Times)**: Presents the eruption as a fiery spectacle and milestone "23rd episode" since December, repeating headline fountain heights and summarizing the timeline for a global readership. By packaging the event as eye-catching world news for clicks, it leans on sensational details while offering only cursory mention of on-the-ground risks, reflecting limited local stake and commercial incentives.
