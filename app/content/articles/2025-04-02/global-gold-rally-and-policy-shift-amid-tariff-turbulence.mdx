# Global Gold Rally and Policy Shift Amid Tariff Turbulence

In early April 2025, gold prices surged to record highs worldwide as mounting US tariff threats and geopolitical tensions drove investors to safe-haven assets, while major policy adjustments, such as India winding down its gold monetization scheme, underscored shifting global dynamics.

#### Focusing Facts

- Gold prices hit record highs with US spot levels exceeding $3,150 and Kalgoorlie prices reaching AUD $5,000 an ounce.

- India's Gold Monetization Scheme mobilized only 31.16 metric tonnes of gold from 2015 to 2024, far below its import levels.

- ETFs saw significant inflows in Q1 2025—between 130 to 150 metric tonnes—reflecting heightened demand amid trade uncertainties.

#### Context

This episode of a gold rally is reminiscent of past periods of extreme market stress such as the 1970s oil shocks and the 2008 financial crisis when safe-haven buying drove significant price spikes. During those times, as today, monetary easing and geopolitical risks spurred investors to seek refuge in gold. The contrast between soaring speculative demand and strategic policy shifts—illustrated by India’s decision to curtail its inefficient monetization scheme—highlights a long-term trend where structural economic imbalances and rising protectionism prompt sharp reallocations to tangible assets. On a centennial scale, while these surges can signal periods of acute anxiety, historical corrections have subsequently rebalanced markets, affirming that gold’s enduring role is as a hedge in cycles of dramatic financial and political change.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US financial media**: They portray the surge in gold prices as a safe haven response to tariff uncertainty and broader economic fears driven by President Trump’s protectionist policies. They may exaggerate the impact of political tariffs and focus narrowly on the safe‐haven narrative to support a bullish outlook on gold investments. ([Yahoo!

- **Australian local media**: They emphasize that while record gold prices boost local mining and attract investment, there is a stark two-speed economy with rising cost-of-living challenges for ordinary residents. This perspective can underplay the broader economic risks by focusing on local benefits and downplaying the hardships faced by non-mining communities.

- **Institutional analyst outlets**: They analyze gold’s rally with a focus on technical factors such as ETF inflows, central bank purchases, and market momentum while forecasting potential upside if geopolitical risks intensify. Their forecasts may rely heavily on quantitative models and institutional metrics, potentially overlooking unpredictable macroeconomic shifts.
