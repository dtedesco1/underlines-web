# China Escalates Cross-Strait Tensions with Multi-Force Drills Around Taiwan

On April 1, 2025, China launched unannounced joint military drills around Taiwan targeting President Lai Ching-te’s pro-independence stance.

#### Focusing Facts

- PLA deployed 19 naval vessels including the Shandong carrier in coordinated sea, air, and missile force exercises.

- Taiwan tracked 71 Chinese aircraft and 21 warships, and activated missile systems in response.

- The drills were in direct retaliation to Lai’s March 13 speech, which outlined a 17-point countermeasure strategy.

#### Context

Historically, power plays like the Berlin Blockade of 1948—where Soviet forces imposed extreme measures to reshape post-war order—offer a lens to view today’s cross-strait provocations. China’s use of comprehensive military drills reflects a long-term trend of regional coercion reminiscent of Cold War tactics, leveraging both kinetic and psychological warfare to assert dominance. In a century-long perspective, this standoff is part of evolving strategies in hybrid conflict domains, underscoring shifts in global power that may recalibrate international security architectures for decades to come.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western Liberal Media**: They depict China's military drills as a deliberate, provocative act aimed at intimidating Taiwan and pressuring the US, thereby escalating regional tensions and undermining democratic values. This narrative may overemphasize the threat from China and frame events primarily through a Western liberal, anti-authoritarian lens that supports strong international responses.

- **Right-Leaning, Militaristic Outlets**: They emphasize that the Chinese drills are a 'severe warning' meant to deter Taiwan's independence, reinforcing a narrative of aggressive Chinese military posturing that justifies strong US and allied deterrence. This perspective is often driven by hawkish, nationalist sentiments and may exaggerate the immediacy of the threat to advocate for increased military spending and robust defensive measures.

- **Local/Regional Security Voices**: They focus on the direct regional consequences, urging local military preparedness and highlighting the risk of conflict spillover, especially for neighboring countries like the Philippines. This view can be influenced by immediate local security concerns and nationalist priorities, potentially stressing local vulnerabilities in the face of broader geopolitical tensions.
