# OpenAI Shifts Gears: Unveils Open-Weights AI Amid $40bn Funding Surge

On March 31/April 1, OpenAI announced its first open-weights language model since GPT-2 while finalizing a historic $40bn funding round led by SoftBank, propelling its valuation to $300bn.

#### Focusing Facts

- Raised $40bn with SoftBank and partners, valuing the company at $300bn.

- Announced the first open-weights language model in months, with developer events in San Francisco, Europe, and Asia-Pacific planned.

- Reported operating costs of $7-8bn annually, amid competition from low-cost rivals like DeepSeek.

#### Context

This development marks a pivotal strategic pivot reminiscent of historical shifts such as the open systems revolution during the rise of Linux in the 1990s. OpenAI’s decision to open up its model—previously kept proprietary in its ChatGPT iterations—reflects a broader industry trend of commoditizing foundational technologies, as competitors like DeepSeek and Meta challenge traditional revenue models with far lower operational costs. As with IBM’s recalibration in the early ’90s to embrace open standards, OpenAI’s dual move to engage the developer community and secure massive capital underscores a long-term transition toward more democratized AI research and deployment. Over the next century, such structural shifts could redefine innovation ecosystems, shifting value from proprietary algorithms to the applications built upon open, adaptable foundations.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Tech-focused media**: These outlets frame OpenAI's open-weight model release as a strategic response to increasing competitive pressure from open-source rivals like DeepSeek and Meta’s Llama, highlighting technical innovation and cost-efficiency. Their coverage may emphasize the technical and economic rationales for the shift while downplaying ethical, safety, or broader societal risks associated with more open models.

- **Mainstream Business Media**: These sources stress OpenAI’s landmark funding round and elevated market valuation while noting the shift to an open model as part of a broader repositioning amid fierce competition. They tend to highlight the financial and strategic accolades, potentially glossing over concerns about security, the risks inherent in open model deployment, and long-term operational challenges.
