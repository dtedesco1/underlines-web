# DeepSeek's R1 AI Model Shakes Global Tech Industry with Low-Cost Innovations

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released the R1 model, disrupting the AI market by training it at a fraction of the cost of competitors like OpenAI, leading to significant shifts in tech stock values.

#### Focusing Facts

- Nvidia's market value dropped by nearly $600 billion following DeepSeek R1's success.

- The US stock market saw a $1 trillion loss in a single day due to DeepSeek's R1 model release.

- DeepSeek claims to have trained its model with only $5.6 million using 2000 Nvidia H800 GPUs, contrasting OpenAI's $20 billion investment.

#### Context

The release of DeepSeek's R1 model parallels the historical impact of Japan's tech rise in the 1980s, which similarly disrupted Western tech dominance. This event reflects a longer trend of increasing innovation efficiency in AI, driven by global competition and resource constraints. DeepSeek's advances challenge the existing belief that state-of-the-art AI requires vast capital, similar to the reduced costs of computing seen in the 1980s-90s. On a century-long timeline, this could signify a shift towards an era where global tech advances become democratized, challenging existing power structures and necessitating adaptive strategies from entrenched tech leaders.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Local news**: Microsoft's integration of DeepSeek's R1 into various platforms is a strategic move to enhance user applications, despite concerns around data origins. This perspective might downplay the legal and ethical concerns associated with how DeepSeek allegedly trained its models using data improperly sourced from OpenAI.

- **Chinese state owned media**: DeepSeek's affordable AI model marks a significant technological breakthrough for China, challenging US tech supremacy and showcasing innovation amid restrictions. This perspective may overly celebrate Chinese technology advancements while neglecting detailed scrutiny of their legality and methodology, especially given the accusations of IP theft.

- **Right leaning media**: DeepSeek's rise is a threat to US technological dominance and underscores the need for stringent protective measures regarding AI intellectual property. This viewpoint likely emphasizes nationalist concerns and could exaggerate the negative impacts to rally support for protectionist policies against Chinese tech companies.
