# India's Economic Survey 2024-25 Presented Before Union Budget

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2024-25, evaluating the past fiscal year amidst economic challenges and setting the stage for the Union Budget 2025.

#### Focusing Facts

- India's GDP growth for FY24 was at 8.2%, marking the third straight year of over 7% growth.

- Corporate profitability reached a 15-year high in FY24, with a profit-to-GDP ratio of 4.8%.

- The Economic Survey emphasized income inequality concerns due to disproportionate profit and wage growth.

#### Context

The Economic Survey, an annual tradition since India's Independence, mirrors the UK's Blue Book model, used to assess economic trends before fiscal policy announcements. Historically, such surveys have guided policy shifts, as seen in 1991's economic liberalization based on previous surveys. Today, challenges like income inequality amidst corporate profits echo global shifts seen in the Gilded Age of the 19th century, where disparity spurred policy change. On a century-spanning view, the 2024-25 Economic Survey reflects ongoing themes of economic growth intertwined with social disparities. Observing how policy adaptations from these surveys impact India's position as a global economic power will be crucial.
