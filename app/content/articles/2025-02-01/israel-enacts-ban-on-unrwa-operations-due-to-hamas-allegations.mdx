# Israel Enacts Ban on UNRWA Operations Due to Hamas Allegations

The Israeli government has formalized a ban on UNRWA's operations in Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem, despite international condemnation, effective from January 30, 2025.

#### Focusing Facts

- Israel passed a law in October 2024, forbidding UNRWA from operating on its territories, with implementation starting January 30, 2025.

- Around 18 governments initially froze funding to UNRWA over alleged ties to Hamas, but most resumed funding after an internal UN investigation found no concrete evidence.

- The ban affects up to 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem, who rely on UNRWA for essential services.

#### Context

Israel's ban on UNRWA and its restriction on services in Palestinian territories mirror historical interventions where state security was prioritized over humanitarian concerns. For instance, post-Partition India in 1949 restricted work by international agencies in Kashmir, citing sovereignty and security. This current Israeli policy echoes a long-term trend of states seeking sovereign control over contested territories, often sidelining international humanitarian efforts. On a 100-year timescale, this moment may reflect the ongoing challenges in addressing statelessness and rights of return in international law, highlighting failures in resolving protracted refugee situations. The significance lies in the potential destabilization of regional stability as millions of Palestinians face uncertainty in humanitarian support.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Al Jazeera Online**: The ban on UNRWA by Israel is seen as a drastic move that severely impacts humanitarian efforts and the lives of Palestinian refugees. There is a strong emphasis on the humanitarian crisis and the negative implications for Palestinians, which might downplay any security concerns Israel has voiced or legitimate criticisms of UNRWA.

- **Fox News**: Israel's decision to ban UNRWA operations is justified due to the agency's alleged ties with Hamas and its failure in providing true humanitarian aid. This perspective critically highlights alleged security threats and downplays the humanitarian role of UNRWA, framing it largely as a threat to Israelâ€™s national security.

- **The Times of Israel**: Israel's legislation against UNRWA aims to address national security concerns following accusations of the agency's infiltration by Hamas. The perspective might emphasize Israeli sovereignty and security at the risk of dismissing the humanitarian impact on Palestinians, focusing on the legitimacy of Israel's claims.

- **The Independent**: The ban on UNRWA is a significant humanitarian and political event that risks destabilizing the region and affecting millions of refugees. This view could potentially overemphasize the humanitarian impact while not fully addressing Israel's security concerns or the organization's alleged misconducts.
