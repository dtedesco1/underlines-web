# Samsung Gains Approval for AI Chip Supply Amid Profit Struggles

Samsung Electronics has secured approval from Nvidia to supply its less advanced 8-layer HBM3E chips for the Chinese AI market, amidst reporting a drop in chip division profits.

#### Focusing Facts

- Samsung's chip division reported a fourth quarter operating profit of 2.9 trillion won ($2.1 billion), missing the analysts' projection of 4.78 trillion won.

- Nvidia approved Samsung's 8-layer HBM3E chips in December 2024, specifically for processors aimed at the Chinese market.

- Samsung aims to launch improved HBM3E chips in March 2025 amidst declining demand due to US export restrictions to China.

#### Context

Samsung's recent approval to supply AI chips to Nvidia for the Chinese market amidst profit declines in its chip division echoes historical patterns of tech competition and market access issues, akin to the early 1980s semiconductor trade frictions between the US and Japan, where strategic shifts were necessary for long-term survival. This event underlines the ongoing challenge of maintaining technological competitiveness in an industry prone to rapid innovation and geopolitical influences. On a centennial timescale, Samsung's efforts to recuperate its position in the AI chip market may parallel the long-term evolution witnessed in other historically significant semiconductor advances, reflecting an enduring cycle of technological catch-up and adaptation to global market dynamics. Such events signal the intricate balance between immediate financial pressures and strategic positioning for future leadership in emerging tech domains.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Korean media (e.g., 중앙일보 and The Korea Times)**: Reports on Samsung's chip profits highlight its struggle against rivals like SK Hynix, reflecting both competitive pressure and the impact of market downturns. Korean sources may emphasize national pride and business resilience, potentially downplaying weaknesses or external challenges faced by major native companies like Samsung.

- **Non-Western media (e.g., ARY NEWS)**: Emphasizes potential barriers to Samsung's success, particularly U.S.-China tensions and export restrictions impacting the company's AI chip sales. Might portray the U.S. policy impacts with a hint of inherent external victimization, potentially highlighting the intractability of geopolitical tensions over local company strategies.
