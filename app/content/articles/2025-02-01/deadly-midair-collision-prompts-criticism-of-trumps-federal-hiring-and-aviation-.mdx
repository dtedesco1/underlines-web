# Deadly Midair Collision Prompts Criticism of Trump's Federal Hiring and Aviation Safety Reforms

A deadly midair collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter near Reagan National Airport killed 67 people, amid controversy over Trump's recent federal hiring freeze and firing of key aviation safety officials.

#### Focusing Facts

- American Eagle Flight 5342 and a Black Hawk helicopter collided on January 29, 2025, killing all 67 on board.

- The Trump administration implemented a federal hiring freeze on January 20, 2025, without exempting the FAA.

- Trump disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, formed after 1988's PanAm 103 bombing.

#### Context

The midair crash harkens back not only to past aviation tragedies but also to broader trends of political interference in public safety. The removal of key oversight elements, akin to historical analogies like when President Reagan's firing of 11,000 air traffic controllers in 1981 led to prolonged staffing issues, underscores the delicate balance between political change and public safety. This incident situates current debates about aviation safety in a long narrative of under-resourcing and strategic missteps across administrations. Over a 100-year timeline, this moment might serve as a case study in the perils of politicizing critical infrastructure and the enduring necessity of non-partisan technical oversight in sectors like aviation.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: This group's basic interpretation of the crash is that it highlights the dangers of Trump administration policies, emphasizing cuts to aviation safety committees and the federal workforce hiring freeze as potential contributing factors to the disaster. They may exploit the event to highlight perceived incompetence or harmful policies of political opponents to align the narrative with broader political goals.

- **Right leaning media**: This view holds that blaming Trump's recent aviation policy changes for the crash is unfair and premature, citing that such measures wouldn't have an immediate impact on air traffic safety within the short time frame since enactment. They might downplay potential negative impacts of the administration to defend political allies and uphold their narratives against opposing criticism.

- **Aviation industry experts**: The fundamental perspective is the systemic issues in aviation safety, including chronic understaffing, which predates Trump's administration and is exacerbated by complex airspace conditions. Their focus might be to highlight long-standing industry challenges over recent political actions, potentially drawing attention away from immediate administrative decisions.
