# M23 Rebels Seize Control of Major Eastern DRC City Goma amid Growing Regional Tensions

The M23 rebel group, backed by Rwanda, seized Goma, DRC's eastern city, intensifying regional instability.

#### Focusing Facts

- Rwandan-backed M23 rebels took Goma on January 30, 2025, asserting control over the city.

- The UN reported over 100 fatalities and more than 2,000 injuries in violent clashes around Goma during the takeover.

- Burundian troops have joined Congolese forces in attempting to resist M23 advances towards South Kivu.

#### Context

The situation in eastern DRC and the involvement of the M23 echoes the late 1990s' regional conflicts in the Congo, which drew in multiple nations and resulted in millions of deaths. This recent surge in violence underscores the persistent instability in the area, driven largely by ethnic tensions and access to lucrative mineral resources. Over the long term, this conflict exemplifies how historical grievances and external influences continue to impact local dynamics in Africa. The unfolding situation challenges the stability of the region and raises concerns of a possible regional war as it did during the Congo Wars of 1996-2003. Although ostensibly a repetition of former conflicts, this moment is significant as it tests the current international order's ability to address enduring cycles of rebellion and foreign intervention, echoing the impacts of broader geopolitical maneuvers on a century-long scale.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: The M23 rebellion in eastern Congo is largely the result of Rwanda's backing and the complacency of Western governments, making it a humanitarian crisis and a geopolitical issue with global implications. This perspective may emphasize Western governments' failures to act and overlook internal Congolese dynamics, reflecting a critical stance towards Western powers as well as Rwandan involvement.

- **Right leaning media**: The DR Congo crisis depicts Rwanda as unjustly accused of backing M23, highlighting Rwanda's right to defend itself and emphasizing Kagame's denials of military involvement. This perspective is likely to downplay evidence of Rwandan interference, potentially reflecting geopolitical alliances or favoring Rwanda's narrative over humanitarian concerns.

- **Local news**: The ongoing fighting in Goma and surrounding areas is a direct result of failing government action and regional tensions, with a focus on local suffering and the urgent need for a resolution. This perspective might hazardously intertwine Congo's internal failings with regional politics, possibly promoting local narratives of victimization without fully considering complex geopolitical factors.
