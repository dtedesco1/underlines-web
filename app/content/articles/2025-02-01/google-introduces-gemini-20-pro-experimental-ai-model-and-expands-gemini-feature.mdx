# Google Introduces Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental AI Model and Expands Gemini Features

Google launched the Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental AI model and expanded its Gemini features across Google Workspace and Pixel devices.

#### Focusing Facts

- Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental is available to Gemini Advanced users starting January 30, 2025.

- The Gemini AI model allows data analysis in Sheets, now generating contextual insights and Python code-based charts.

- The 'Talk Live about...' feature expands to Pixel 9, announcing a real-time screen interaction capability.

#### Context

The unveiling of Google's Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental marks a significant evolution in the AI capabilities seen in recent tech advancements, somewhat paralleling the way IBM's Watson gained prominence after winning 'Jeopardy!' in 2011 by showcasing AI's potential in real-time application. The expansion of AI capabilities reflects the broader trend of embedding AI deeply within applications for enhanced interactivity and real-time insights, similar to how personal computing spread from niche uses to mainstream adoption during the late 20th century. This push into real-time, user-friendly AI applications could set a precedent for the next decades, as AI becomes an entrenched part of everyday technology, potentially marking 2025 as a pivotal year for user-accessible AI technology akin to the internet's rise in the late 1990s.
