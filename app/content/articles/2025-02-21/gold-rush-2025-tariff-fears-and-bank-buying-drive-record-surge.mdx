# Gold Rush 2025: Tariff Fears and Bank Buying Drive Record Surge

In February 2025, gold’s spot prices surged near $2,950 per ounce as escalating U.S. tariff threats and robust central bank demand intensified safe-haven buying.

#### Focusing Facts

- Between December 18, 2024 and February 19, 2025, gold prices jumped from $2,587.6 to $2,941.1 per ounce.

- A new 360 ONE Gold ETF launched on February 20, 2025 in India at Rs 10 per unit with a minimum investment of Rs 500.

- Local markets, such as in Pakistan, saw 24-carat gold per tola rise by 1,000 rupees to 309,000 rupees.

#### Context

This surge mirrors past periods when gold surged during times of economic paranoia—recalling the 2008 crisis when gold prices spiked as investors fled risky assets. Unlike the early 2000s bull runs, today's rally is driven by a complex cocktail of U.S. trade policy uncertainties under the Trump administration, heightened central bank accumulation, and strategic shifts towards digital and physical asset diversification. As in the early 21st century, when safe-haven flows bolstered gold during crises, these developments underscore a long-term trend: the perennial role of gold as a hedge against systemic shocks, a dynamic that has recurred over the past 100 years in varying forms of global economic distress.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream Financial Media**: These outlets frame the gold rally as a response to geopolitical uncertainty and policy risks, positioning gold as a safe-haven asset amid dramatic global and political developments. This narrative may overemphasize short-term political drama and central bank moves to justify a sustained bull market, potentially overstating risk factors and safe-haven appeal.

- **Contrarian/Anti-Wall Street Analysts**: These voices challenge mainstream Wall Street forecasts by highlighting undervalued gold mining stocks and suggesting that conventional analyses miss the full bullish potential of gold. This perspective often employs anti-establishment rhetoric, potentially ignoring broader market fundamentals while favoring a speculative contrarian narrative.

- **Investment Product & ETF Promoters**: These sources promote gold ETFs as efficient, liquid alternatives that provide direct exposure to the rising gold market amid global uncertainty. These viewpoints may be influenced by product promotion and commercial interests, potentially downplaying risks while emphasizing benefits to attract investors.
