# Musk’s Political Pivot Dims US Focus as Tesla Charges into India

Elon Musk’s intensified political involvement, notably his role in Trump's cost-cutting initiative, has coincided with declining US sales and mounting operational concerns, while Tesla finalizes bold plans to launch retail and manufacturing operations in India by mid-2025.

#### Focusing Facts

- Tesla US car sales dropped by 1% last year versus a global EV market growth of 25%, amid delays on a promised low-cost model.

- Tesla is set to open showrooms in Mumbai’s BKC and New Delhi’s Aerocity, with plans to import vehicles from its Berlin plant and boost local OEM sourcing to over $1 billion by 2025.

- Musk’s active role in Washington as head of DOGE and close ties with Trump coincide with a 25% fall in Tesla’s share price since mid-December, hinting at investor unease.

#### Context

This moment reflects an era of divergent business strategies similar to early automotive industry crossroads. In the 1920s, as Henry Ford revolutionized mass production while navigating political and economic shifts, automakers had to balance innovation with operational focus. Today, Tesla faces a comparable challenge: Musk’s multipronged engagements—ranging from high-profile political roles to global market expansions—risk diluting leadership focus at a time when critical retooling is needed. Over a century later, while Ford’s calculated innovation paved the way for modern manufacturing, Tesla's dual-track approach could either pave the way for transformative global growth, especially in emerging markets like India, or signal a strategic dilution that may undermine its industry leadership over the long term.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream Corporate Critics**: They argue that Elon Musk’s political engagements and divided attentions are undermining Tesla’s core business performance, resulting in declining car sales and shaky internal morale. This perspective may overemphasize the negative impact of Musk's outside interests while aligning with views skeptical of celebrity-led corporate governance.

- **Investor Optimists & Indian Market Enthusiasts**: They focus on Tesla’s strategic moves like its aggressive entry into the promising Indian market as a major growth opportunity, viewing current stock dips as a chance to buy the future. This view might downplay operational risks and the impact of management distractions by highlighting expansion and bullish investment narratives. ([Yahoo!
