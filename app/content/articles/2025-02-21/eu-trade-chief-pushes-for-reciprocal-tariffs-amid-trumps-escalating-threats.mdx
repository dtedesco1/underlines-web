# EU Trade Chief Pushes for Reciprocal Tariffs Amid Trump’s Escalating Threats

Faced with Trump’s announced 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium, and potential car duties, EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič engaged in intensive talks with US officials on February 19-20 to negotiate reciprocal tariff adjustments.

#### Focusing Facts

- EU's net surplus of €50 billion represents roughly 3% of €1.5–1.7 trillion in transatlantic trade.

- Trump announced a 25% duty on steel and aluminium starting March 12 and hinted at a 25% tariff on US car imports by April 2.

- Šefčovič proposed a broader 'Grand Bargain' covering tech regulations and non-trade issues like defense spending.

#### Context

This high-stakes negotiation echoes past episodes of intense tariff disputes such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which led to a destructive trade war. Similar to post-WWII GATT negotiations that aimed to re-establish stable trade rules after global conflicts, today’s discussions represent an effort to recalibrate imbalances amid evolving global economic pressures, including Chinese industrial overcapacity. While these discussions may not dramatically alter the long-term transatlantic economic landscape, they underscore persistent challenges within protectionist trends and the ongoing evolution of multilateral trade systems that have been reshaped over the last century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **EU Diplomatic Negotiators**: They emphasize constructive dialogue, readiness to negotiate on tariffs and broader issues, insisting that trade imbalances are minor and that cooperation can resolve perceived grievances. This group tends to downplay the risks of a trade war and highlights shared transatlantic interests, potentially underestimating domestic political pressures and aggressive rhetoric from the US side.

- **Tariff Threat Advocates**: They focus on Trump’s aggressive tariff threats and criticisms of the EU's trade policies, portraying the measures as unbalanced and warning of a damaging trade war. This narrative emphasizes conflict and grievance, possibly overstating US claims and nationalistic rhetoric to justify protectionist measures.
