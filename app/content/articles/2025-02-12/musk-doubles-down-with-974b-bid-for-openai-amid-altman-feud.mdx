# Musk Doubles Down with $97.4B Bid for OpenAI Amid Altman Feud

On February 10, 2025, a consortium led by Elon Musk submitted a $97.4 billion bid to acquire OpenAI’s nonprofit arm, directly challenging CEO Sam Altman’s vision of transitioning OpenAI to a for-profit model.

#### Focusing Facts

- Bid submitted on February 10, 2025 via Musk’s lawyer Marc Toberoff by a group led by Musk and backed by xAI.

- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed the offer with the remark, 'no thank you but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion' on X.

- Musk’s legal actions include a 2024 injunction over OpenAI's for-profit conversion and disputes over asset valuation.

#### Context

The conflict echoes historical corporate battles such as the tech disputes during the late 1990s and early antitrust actions of the early 20th century. The feud over OpenAI’s direction reflects a long-term struggle between maintaining foundational nonprofit ideals and the need for capital in scaling disruptive technologies. As Silicon Valley evolves, this standoff between Musk and Altman could reshape how AI technologies are governed, with potential impacts on innovation, public interest, and regulatory frameworks over the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Musk-led investor camp**: They argue that OpenAI’s departure from its nonprofit roots and open-source mission is a betrayal that must be corrected by reverting to its original, safety-focused mandate. This perspective may simplify complex financial and innovation challenges by idealizing nonprofit principles and downplaying the reasons behind the for-profit transformation.

- **OpenAI leadership camp**: They contend that transforming into a for-profit entity is essential to secure significant capital and drive future innovation in the competitive AI landscape. This stance might understate concerns about straying from the founding mission and oversimplify the criticisms of financial motivations driving the transition.
