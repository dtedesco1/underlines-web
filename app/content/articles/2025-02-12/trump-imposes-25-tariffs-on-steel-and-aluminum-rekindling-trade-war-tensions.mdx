# Trump Imposes 25% Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum, Rekindling Trade War Tensions

In February 2025, President Trump signed an order imposing 25% tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum, with reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners promised to follow, intensifying trade conflict with key suppliers.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump’s executive order, signed in February 2025, mandates a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, effective as early as March 12.

- The tariffs target major suppliers including Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and others, with plans for reciprocal duties announced to level trade imbalances.

- Gold prices surged near record levels above $2,921 an ounce as investors sought safe havens amid escalating trade tensions.

#### Context

This move echoes Trump’s earlier tariffs from his first term (2018) and recalls historical protectionist measures such as the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, which attempted to shield domestic industries while provoking global trade retaliation. The renewed tariffs reflect long-term trends toward economic nationalism and trade rebalancing, yet they risk disrupting integrated supply chains and inflating costs. Viewed over the next century, such escalations signify recurring shifts in global trade policy that reshape relationships among major economies, with impacts that may ultimately be absorbed or reversed as international norms evolve.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream International News**: These outlets present the tariffs as a risky escalation in global trade tensions that could destabilize longstanding economic relationships and inflict broader economic consequences. They emphasize the geopolitical and economic disruptions while sometimes downplaying the stated intent of protecting domestic jobs, reflecting concerns over international backlash.

- **Market-Focused Financial Analysis**: This group interprets the tariffs as catalysts for market uncertainty, pointing to record high gold prices and increased haven demand as immediate financial market reactions. Their focus on short-term market indicators may understate long-term economic impacts and broader policy implications in favor of quantifiable financial movements.

- **US Nationalist/Tariff Advocates**: These articles highlight the tariffs as assertive measures aimed at bolstering domestic production, protecting American industries, and renegotiating trade dynamics on more favorable terms. They tend to stress the benefits to national economic interests and job creation while overlooking potential retaliatory risks and international repercussions.
