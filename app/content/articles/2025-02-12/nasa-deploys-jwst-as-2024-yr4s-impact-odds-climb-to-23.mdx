# NASA Deploys JWST as 2024 YR4’s Impact Odds Climb to 2.3%

Revised observations have bumped asteroid 2024 YR4’s impact probability to about 2.3% for a potential December 22, 2032 collision, prompting NASA and ESA to use the James Webb Space Telescope for vital infrared measurements.

#### Focusing Facts

- Updated data now suggest a 2.3% (1-in-43) chance of impact on December 22, 2032.

- JWST is scheduled to observe 2024 YR4 in March and May 2025 to refine size estimates between 40m and 90m.

- A potential impact is estimated to release roughly 15 megatons of TNT, akin to the 1908 Tunguska event.

#### Context

This event mirrors past incidents like the 1908 Tunguska explosion, which devastated 2,150 sq km in Siberia, and recalls the scrutiny of near-miss asteroids such as Apophis in 2004. While the threat from 2024 YR4 is localized rather than globally catastrophic, its reassessment using advanced infrared techniques from JWST marks a significant evolution in planetary defense measures. Over the next century, escalating observational precision and rapid response systems could redefine how we manage such hazards, underscoring a long-term shift from reliance on rough ground-based estimates to sophisticated, spaceborne surveillance.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Sensationalist Media**: They portray the asteroid 2024 YR4 as a looming, catastrophic 'city-killer' threat, emphasizing emergency decisions and dramatic potential impact scenarios. This group tends to use provocative language and focus on worst-case outcomes to attract attention, potentially exaggerating the immediate danger and urgency.

- **Scientific and Technical Reporting**: They present the situation by focusing on the scientific details, uncertainties in asteroid size and impact probability, and the need for improved measurement with NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. This group relies on technical explanations and official agency statements, which might understate the emotional impact or severity to avoid public panic while emphasizing the ongoing nature of risk assessments.
