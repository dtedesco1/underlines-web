# Israeli Raid in Nur Shams: Pregnant Woman Killed as Shoot-to-Kill Orders Escalate

On February 9-10, 2025, Israeli forces conducted a multi-front raid in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank, during which a 23-year-old pregnant Palestinian woman, along with other civilians, was killed amid reports of expanded shoot-to-kill orders.

#### Focusing Facts

- 23-year-old Sundus Jamal Muhammad Shalabi, eight months pregnant, was killed in Nur Shams with her husband critically injured.

- Israeli military orders reportedly allowed soldiers to use lethal force against any unarmed Palestinian, with new directives coming from Central Command and the West Bank Division.

- The operation involved heavy machinery, house demolitions, and displacement of thousands, linking actions in Nur Shams with broader incursions in Jenin and Tulkarem.

#### Context

This latest raid is a continuation of a long-standing cycle of confrontation in the occupied West Bank. The tactics echo past incursions—such as the 2002 Jenin assault that resulted in significant casualties and displacement—while signaling a shift in Israeli military strategy post the January ceasefire in Gaza. Over the past year, the West Bank has endured relentless military actions, reflecting historical patterns dating back to the Nakba and the Intifadas, where military offensives both aimed to crush resistance and reshape the demographic landscape. In a broader historical context, this latest escalation is part of a century-long conflict over land, identity, and self-determination in the region, and while the current operation has immediate tragic humanitarian costs, its long-term significance lies in the persistent cycle of resistance and countermeasures that have defined this area since 1948.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Palestinian Sympathetic Media**: These articles interpret the West Bank raids as part of a wider oppressive campaign by the Israeli military that deliberately targets civilians, including pregnant women, and demolishes Palestinian homes and resistance hubs. They tend to emphasize human suffering and historical grievances to portray Israel as an occupying force, potentially downplaying the security arguments or militant dimensions presented by Israeli officials.

- **Security-Focused Narratives**: This group portrays the Israeli military operations as necessary counterterrorism measures aimed at neutralizing threats and targeting militants while also citing official claims of targeting terrorists. They may understate civilian casualties or contextualize events in a way that justifies aggressive military tactics, favoring the narrative of security over humanitarian concerns.

- **Critical In-Depth Analysis**: This perspective provides a complex narrative that highlights not only Israeli military aggression but also the internal Palestinian power struggles, including collusion between PA forces and Israel, and the broader geopolitical manipulation in the region. Its critique of both the Israeli state and elements within Palestinian governance may blend factual reportage with editorialized commentary, potentially overstating the coordinated nature of these dynamics.
