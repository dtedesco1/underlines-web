# Egypt to Host Summit as Trump Unveils Gaza Takeover and Displacement Plan

Egypt is set to convene an emergency Arab summit on February 27, 2025, in response to US President Trump’s controversial proposal to forcibly relocate nearly two million Palestinians and assume control of Gaza.

#### Focusing Facts

- Egypt, coordinating with Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and UAE, will host the summit on February 27, 2025.

- Trump’s plan includes relocating 1.9–2.1 million Palestinians with no right of return, and he threatened to cut aid to Egypt and Jordan if they resist.

- Arab nations, including Egypt and Jordan, have denounced the plan as a violation of international law and a form of ethnic cleansing.

#### Context

This moment recalls historical episodes where major powers attempted forced population transfers to reshape contested regions, such as the mass displacements of Palestinians in 1948 and the population exchanges following the Greco-Turkish War in 1923. The current event is part of a long-standing trend of geopolitical reordering through forced migration and territorial acquisition, reflecting a dangerous precedent in international relations. While the immediate regional implications are severe, the long-term historical lesson warns that initiatives substituting statecraft with real estate developments risk destabilizing established demographic and legal norms, a pattern that could resonate well into the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Arab and Regional Governments**: They view Trump’s proposal as a blatant violation of Palestinian rights and regional sovereignty, arguing that forced displacement undercuts the cause for a viable Palestinian state and disrupts regional stability. This perspective is driven by nationalist and regional solidarity motives, emphasizing Palestinian rights and rejecting foreign intervention regardless of potential economic incentives.

- **Pro-Trump/US Executive and Conservative Media**: They frame the plan as an innovative development strategy—likening Gaza to a future real estate project that guarantees improved housing and safe communities, with the U.S. taking the lead to modernize the area. This group downplays humanitarian concerns and international legal implications, favoring strong executive action and economic narratives over potential ethical costs.

- **International/Diplomatic Critics**: They criticize the plan as reckless, warning that forcibly relocating millions could amount to ethnic cleansing and a serious breach of international law, further destabilizing an already volatile region. This stance is influenced by liberal and human rights advocacies that prioritize legal norms and humanitarian considerations, potentially underestimating the executive’s claims of development benefits.
