# OpenAI Taps Out Custom AI Chip to Break Nvidia Monopoly

On February 10–11, 2025, OpenAI advanced a critical milestone by finalizing the design of its first custom AI chip, signaling a strategic move to reduce its reliance on Nvidia with fabrication planned at TSMC using 3nm technology.

#### Focusing Facts

- The chip design, set for a tape-out at TSMC’s advanced 3nm process, is aimed for mass production by 2026.

- OpenAI’s in-house team, led by ex-Google engineer Richard Ho, has recently doubled to 40 members to accelerate the chip design effort.

- The tape-out phase costs tens of millions and typically takes about six months to yield a functional prototype.

#### Context

OpenAI’s move echoes historic shifts in computing—akin to Intel’s 8086 launch in 1978, which redefined computer architecture and set long-term industry trends. By developing an in-house chip, OpenAI is not only addressing the immediate need to diversify its hardware supply chain away from a near-monopolistic reliance on Nvidia but also setting the stage for a gradual transformation in AI infrastructure. Over a century, such strategic pivots have reshaped technological ecosystems, suggesting that this effort could eventually influence broader market dynamics and supplier negotiations in the semiconductor arena.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Tech-focused media**: These outlets emphasize OpenAI’s move as a bold innovation that could disrupt Nvidia’s market lead by reducing dependency and offering a strategic technological breakthrough. They focus on the advancements and potential to reshape the industry, sometimes downplaying the engineering challenges and inherent risks in custom chip development.

- **Mainstream news wire**: This group highlights the technical risks, high costs, and uncertainties linked to the chip development process, casting the project as a cautious bet with potential pitfalls. By emphasizing risks and detailed process challenges, they may understate the innovation aspect and long-term strategic benefits of reducing chip dependency.

- **Financial media**: Financial analysts view the chip design effort as a strategic leverage tool to boost negotiating power and impact market performance, linking it with shifts in stock outlooks. Their analysis tends to prioritize short-term market implications and stock movements, potentially overlooking broader technological and operational challenges. ([Yahoo!
