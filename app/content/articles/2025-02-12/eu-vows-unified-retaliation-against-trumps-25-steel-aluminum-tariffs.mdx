# EU Vows Unified Retaliation Against Trump's 25% Steel & Aluminum Tariffs

On February 10-11, 2025, President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports with effect from March 12, provoking immediate and coordinated counter-threats from EU leaders.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump’s order imposes a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum with no exemptions, effective March 12, 2025.

- EU officials, including Ursula von der Leyen and Olaf Scholz, promised proportional countermeasures targeting U.S. exports like motorcycles, bourbon, and denim.

- Trump’s action echoes his previous tariffs in his first term, with renewed threats also targeting Canada, Mexico, and China.

#### Context

This escalation recalls past episodes of unilateral tariff impositions, such as the 2018 trade tensions during Trump’s first presidency, and even long-standing disputes like the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 that reshaped global economic relations through retaliatory measures. The current move reflects enduring systemic conflicts in global trade where protectionist policies threaten integrated supply chains established since post-WWII. While history shows that such actions often trigger countermeasures that disrupt markets in the short term, the long-term trend underscores a gradual movement toward multilateral negotiations and recalibrated trade rules in an interconnected world economy.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European Authorities and Pro-European Media**: They argue that Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum are unjustified and economically counterproductive, and insist on a swift, unified EU countermeasure to protect European interests. Their narratives favor EU unity and economic protectionism, potentially overstating the legal and economic flaws of US policies to rally domestic support.

- **US Tariff Advocates (Trump Administration Perspective)**: They maintain that imposing high tariffs is a necessary tool to shield American industries from global competition and to force fairer trade practices. This perspective may downplay the risk of retaliatory trade wars and economic fallout, framing protectionism as unambiguously beneficial for domestic producers.
