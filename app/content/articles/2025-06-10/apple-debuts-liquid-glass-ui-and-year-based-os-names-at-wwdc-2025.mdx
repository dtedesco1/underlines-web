# Apple Debuts 'Liquid Glass' UI and Year-Based OS Names at WWDC 2025

Apple on 9 June 2025 revealed an all-device ‘Liquid Glass’ interface and re-branded its software as iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, etc., its first full-scale design and naming overhaul since 2013.

#### Focusing Facts

- Liquid Glass rolls out across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26 and tvOS 26, shipping publicly in fall 2025 with developer betas available immediately.

- Sequential version numbers were dropped; the operating systems now carry the year they will be in use—e.g., iOS 26 replaces the expected iOS 19.

- Apple extended its 2024 OpenAI partnership for ChatGPT integration while delaying the highly-touted next-gen Siri upgrade.

#### Context

Big visual resets at Apple are rare: Aqua (2001) accompanied the first Mac OS X; the flat iOS 7 redesign landed in 2013 amid the smartphone boom. Like Microsoft’s Aero Glass in Windows Vista (2007), Liquid Glass revives translucency to signal a generational shift, but history shows such aesthetic leaps (often tied to hardware advances) risk backlash when they outpace utility—think the skeuomorphic purge that split users a decade ago. The move toward a uniform design and car-style model-year naming points to a longer arc: Apple wants its devices, from watch to Vision Pro, to feel like one continuous surface, pre-staging a rumored all-glass “Glasswing” iPhone in 2027 and, ultimately, ambient AR interfaces. On the century scale, the story isn’t shiny pixels; it’s how dominant platforms periodically reinvent their visual grammar to maintain lock-in while scrambling to bolt on the next computing wave—in this case, AI. Liquid Glass may be remembered less for its sparkle than for marking the moment Apple publicly conceded it was catching up, not leading, in the post-chatbot era.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Financial/business news outlets**: Portray WWDC as Apple’s bid to catch up in the AI race, stressing that the Liquid Glass overhaul and OpenAI tie-up still leave the company short of a headline-grabbing AI breakthrough investors crave. By writing for markets and shareholders, they spotlight competitive pressure and stock implications, which can lead them to underplay product‐design innovations that lack immediate revenue impact.

- **Apple-centric enthusiast media**: Hail Liquid Glass as Apple’s most sweeping design change since iOS 7, trumpeting its unified look across devices and teasing it as a glimpse of futuristic hardware to come. Reliant on Apple’s ecosystem for scoops and audience interest, they echo the company’s promotional language and downplay delays or gaps in promised AI features.

- **Tech industry websites**: Offer a feature-by-feature rundown that confirms rumors, highlighting Liquid Glass’s transparency effects, the workload it creates for developers, and the notable AI capabilities that failed to materialize. Chasing clicks through rumor score-keeping and feature deep dives, they may accentuate missing elements and developer challenges to sustain reader excitement and debate.
