# Bad Weather Pushes Axiom-4 ISS Launch to 11 June, Delaying India’s Return to Human Spaceflight

Stormy forecasts at Cape Canaveral forced SpaceX and Axiom Space to slip the multinational Ax-4 launch—from 10 June to 11 June 2025—postponing by 24 hours the first Indian-piloted visit to the ISS.

#### Focusing Facts

- Re-scheduled liftoff now set for 11 June 2025 at 17:30 IST (08:00 EDT) from Launch Complex-39A, Kennedy Space Center.

- ISRO is paying roughly ₹550 crore (≈US$66 million) for Shubhanshu Shukla’s seat and associated research on the 14-day mission.

- Ax-4 will carry out about 60 experiments representing 31 countries, the most ever on an Axiom commercial flight.

#### Context

Weather-scrubbed launches have derailed milestones before—think of Apollo 12’s lightning-struck pad delay in November 1969 or STS-41D’s month-long slip after a July 1984 pad fire—reminding us that even in an age of reusable rockets, Earth’s atmosphere still dictates launch windows. The Ax-4 deferral sits at the crossroads of three long arcs: (1) the shift from superpower-run spaceflight to commercial, multinational crews, echoing the 1990s transition from Mir to the ISS; (2) India’s slow but steady bid, after its 1984 Interkosmos voyage and the aborted NASA shuttle plans that died with Challenger in 1986, to build sovereign human-flight capability culminating in Gaganyaan (target 2027); and (3) low-Earth orbit’s gradual commodification, as private labs and national science agencies now rent time aboard a station slated for retirement in the 2030s. On a century scale, a one-day slip is trivial, yet each cooperative mission seeds the norms, hardware reuse, and cross-border trust likely to define human presence in orbit—and potentially beyond—well into the 2100s.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian national media (Hindustan Times, MoneyControl, Times of India, Economic Times, DNA India)**: See the Axiom-4 launch as a historic milestone that restores India's place in human space-flight and showcases the country’s growing technological prowess. Stories lean heavily on patriotic pride and political messaging—highlighting Modi-era achievements, large ambitions and inspirational rhetoric—while glossing over that the flight is paid for and flown on US commercial hardware. ([Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/launch-of-axiom-4-mission-carrying-indias-shubhanshu-shukla-postponed-to-june-11-101749480147720.html), [MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/axiom-4-mission-carrying-indian-astronaut-shubhanshu-shukla-postponed-to-june-11-due-to-weather-13106421.html))

- **International mainstream media (The Guardian)**: Frames the mission as evidence that India is racing to ‘catch up’ with the US, Russia and China in space and positioning itself within a competitive global landscape. This competitive framing can minimise the intrinsic scientific value of the trip and cast India chiefly as a latecomer rather than a peer, reflecting a Western-centric lens.

- **Local Florida news outlets (WESH)**: Treat the flight largely as a Space Coast launch story, stressing the weather delay, launch times and webcast information for viewers. By focusing on logistics and the local spectacle, these reports overlook the broader geopolitical and scientific importance, reflecting commercial-tourism priorities of the region.
