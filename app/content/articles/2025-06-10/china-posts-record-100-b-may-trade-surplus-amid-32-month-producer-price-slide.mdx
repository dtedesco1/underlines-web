# China Posts Record $100 B May Trade Surplus Amid 32-Month Producer-Price Slide

May 2025 data showed prices still falling while the monthly trade surplus surpassed $100 billion for the first time, highlighting China’s growing dependence on exports as domestic demand weakens.

#### Focusing Facts

- NBS: May 2025 CPI −0.1% YoY (4th straight month negative) and PPI −3.3% YoY (32nd consecutive monthly drop).

- Customs data: Exports +4.8%, imports −3.4% in May, generating a US$100 billion+ surplus and lifting the 12-month surplus to US$1.13 trillion (≈5.4% of GDP).

- Beijing trimmed its longstanding inflation target to 2% for 2025, the first cut from the 3% level set in 2004.

#### Context

China’s flirtation with deflation echoes Japan’s post-1991 stagnation, when CPI turned negative in 1998 even as the country ran persistent current-account surpluses; both cases pair aging populations with industrial overcapacity.  Long-term, the May figures reinforce a decade-long tilt from investment- and property-led expansion toward export reliance, a pattern last seen in the late-19th-century United States after the 1873 panic, when falling domestic prices co-existed with booming trade.  Persistent price declines can entrench debt burdens and sap consumption, but large external surpluses also give Beijing fiscal and currency firepower—unlike Japan, China still controls capital flows and can devalue if needed.  Whether policymakers exploit that room or repeat Japan’s hesitant stimulus will shape global trade balances and commodity demand well into the second half of the 21st century; today’s record surplus is a symptom, not a cure, of structural demand fragility.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International news agencies**: China’s latest CPI and PPI data confirm that deflationary pressures are entrenched and remain a cause for economic concern. By spotlighting falling prices without mentioning areas of resilience, the report may play up worries about China’s slowdown, a framing that resonates with outlets keen to underline vulnerabilities in the Chinese economy.

- **Financial market analysts and investor-oriented media**: Deflation persists, but a record trade surplus and stabilising core inflation show that external demand is keeping growth afloat and limiting broader price weakness. Because investment banks and market venues focus on currency and trade implications, they tend to highlight positives like the surplus and a ‘silver lining’ for the yuan, downplaying how weak domestic demand could undermine long-term growth.
