# China Sends Two Carriers Past Second Island Chain in First-Ever Dual Pacific Deployment

Between 8-10 June 2025, China’s Liaoning sailed inside Japan’s EEZ near Minamitorishima while sister carrier Shandong entered Okinotori’s EEZ, marking the first time Beijing operated two aircraft carriers simultaneously east of the Second Island Chain.

#### Focusing Facts

- Japan tracked Liaoning and seven escorts on 8 June 2025 roughly 300 km (185 mi) southwest of Minamitorishima, inside Japan’s EEZ but outside its 12-nm territorial sea.

- On 9 June 2025 Shandong, with four accompanying warships, moved inside Okinotori’s EEZ; Tokyo confirmed both carriers were in the Pacific at the same time—an unprecedented occurrence.

- Both groups conducted fighter-jet and helicopter launch/landing drills after exiting the EEZs, demonstrating blue-water flight-deck operations more than 600 km east of Guam.

#### Context

Great-power navies have long signalled rising ambition by pushing carrier forces beyond traditional bastions—Britain’s 1908 World Cruise, the U.S. Great White Fleet (1907-09) and Japan’s Kido Butai striking Pearl Harbor from far east of Iwo Jima in 1941 all served notice that regional fleets had become blue-water forces.  China, carrier-less until Liaoning’s 2012 commissioning, is compressing that century-long evolution into a decade.  By breaching the Second Island Chain with two carriers, Beijing tests logistics, C2, and political resolve of the U.S.–Japan alliance, challenging the post-1945 assumption of uncontested American depth in the mid-Pacific.  Yet the ski-jump Liaoning and Shandong still lack catapults and nuclear power, echoing the Soviet Navy’s limited Kiev cruises of the late 1980s—impressive but not decisive.  Whether this sortie becomes a footnote or the moment the Western Pacific’s balance truly began tilting will hinge on follow-on deployments, China’s ability to sustain them, and the region’s counter-moves over the coming decades; on a 100-year horizon it could mark the tapering of U.S. maritime hegemony or merely a rehearsal that exposed Beijing’s growing pains.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Japanese national and regional media (e.g., 毎日新聞, CNA)**: They frame the Liaoning’s entry into Japan’s EEZ as proof that China is boosting long-range naval power, requiring Tokyo to heighten surveillance and readiness. Coverage stresses threat perceptions that can buttress domestic defence budgets and political calls for a stronger Self-Defence Force, so the emphasis skews toward worst-case security narratives. ([毎日新聞](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20250609/p2g/00m/0na/023000c), [CNA](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/chinese-aircraft-liaoning-carrier-enters-japan-economic-waters-5170806))

- **Western mainstream and security-focused outlets (Newsweek, The Guardian, Reuters, Bloomberg, Military)**: Reports depict the carrier’s push beyond the second island chain as a significant breach of U.S.–led Pacific ‘defence lines’, underscoring China’s aggressive challenge to existing power balances. Headline language and repeated references to the “largest navy” or “containment strategy” sensationalise Beijing’s moves for Western audiences, reinforcing a great-power competition frame that drives clicks and policy interest.

- **Chinese official perspective carried in regional reporting (statements from China’s Defence & Foreign Ministries)**: Beijing insists the Liaoning task force was conducting routine training fully consistent with international law and not aimed at any country. Official messaging seeks to defuse alarm and present China as a responsible actor, omitting discussion of strategic signaling and thereby downplaying power-projection motives.
