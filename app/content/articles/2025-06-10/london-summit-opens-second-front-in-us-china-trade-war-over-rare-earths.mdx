# London Summit Opens Second Front in US-China Trade War over Rare Earths

High-level delegations from Washington and Beijing convened at Lancaster House on 9-10 June 2025 to rescue a 90-day tariff truce and unblock Chinese rare-earth exports after weeks of mutual accusations of violating a May 12 Geneva accord.

#### Focusing Facts

- The talks bring together Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, USTR Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng for the first in-person meeting since both sides cut tariffs by 115 ppts in Geneva.

- China’s shipments of rare-earth minerals to the US fell nearly 50 % year-on-year in May, prompting Washington to threaten tighter chip curbs and re-impose tariffs as high as 145 %.

- Beijing responded by granting a handful of six-month export licences to suppliers of GM, Ford and Stellantis two days before the London session.

#### Context

Great-power commerce has repeatedly hinged on control of a strategic resource—think Britain’s 19th-century choke-hold on Indian cotton (1840s) or the 1973 OPEC oil embargo that rewired global finance.  Today, rare-earths are playing the role oil once did: a small physical market with outsized leverage over technology and defense supply chains.  The London venue evokes the 1986 US-Japan semiconductor pact, another bout of techno-nationalist bargaining held on neutral ground, and signals a shift from tariff skirmishes toward weaponised export controls.  Over the long arc, this episode illustrates the slow unraveling of the post-1990 hyper-globalised trading system as nations prioritise resilience, industrial policy and geo-economic coercion.  Whether the talks succeed or stall, the precedent of using mineral access and tech licences as bargaining chips will likely echo for decades, shaping a century defined less by free trade and more by contested supply networks.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning U.S. media (Fox News, Fox Business, Breitbart)**: Portrays the London talks as proof that President Trump’s hard-line tariffs are working and predicts a favorable outcome once China yields on rare-earth exports. Applauds Trump’s strategy, stressing U.S. leverage while glossing over economic downsides or the possibility the talks could fail.

- **International mainstream outlets (BBC, Financial Times, CNN, CNA, The Straits Times)**: Describe the negotiations as a cautious attempt to rescue a fragile truce strained by rare-earth curbs and semiconductor restrictions, with success far from guaranteed. Frames both sides as equally responsible for tensions and highlights global economic risks, a posture that can tilt coverage toward worst-case scenarios to underscore journalistic objectivity. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql2x6d2zkgo), [CNN International](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/09/business/us-and-china-fresh-trade-talks-london-int-hnk))

- **Indian national media (India.com)**: Emphasises that China’s choke-hold on rare-earth magnets has hurt Indian manufacturers and warns that a U.S.–China deal could leave India exposed. Adopts a nationalist lens that spotlights India’s vulnerabilities and fosters anxiety about being sidelined, with limited focus on the broader geopolitical context.
