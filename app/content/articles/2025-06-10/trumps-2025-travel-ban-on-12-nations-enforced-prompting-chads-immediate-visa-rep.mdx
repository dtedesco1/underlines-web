# Trump’s 2025 Travel Ban on 12 Nations Enforced, Prompting Chad’s Immediate Visa Reprisal

At 00:01 ET on 9 June 2025, Donald Trump’s new proclamation barring entry of citizens from 12 specified countries formally took effect, triggering reciprocal action from Chad and condemnation from international bodies.

#### Focusing Facts

- The ban covers nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and began nationwide enforcement on 9 June 2025.

- Chad’s President Mahamat Idriss Déby ordered suspension of all visa issuance to U.S. citizens on 5 June 2025, four days before the U.S. order took effect.

- Four countries—Iran, Libya, Sudan and Yemen—were also on Trump’s original 2017 travel-ban list, underscoring policy continuity.

#### Context

Travel bans are hardly novel: in 1882 the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act barred an entire nationality, and the 1941 U.S. freeze on Japanese assets presaged wider wartime exclusion—both framed as security necessities that later drew moral censure. Trump’s 2025 reprise reprises that lineage: executive power wielded during perceived insecurity to tighten the symbolic ‘gate’. Two systemic currents converge here: first, the post-9/11 securitisation of migration, where visa-overstay data and isolated terror incidents (e.g., 1 June 2025 Boulder attack) are leveraged for broad restrictions; second, an accelerating multipolar backlash, evidenced by Chad’s swift reciprocity and the African Union’s warnings, signalling that smaller states now wield tit-for-tat tools once rare against Washington. On a century horizon, such episodic bans rarely endure (the 2017 ban was partly dismantled by 2021), but they leave bureaucratic scaffolding and jurisprudence that normalise executive migration controls. Whether this moment hardens a long-term decoupling between the U.S. and parts of Africa/Middle East, or is later reversed like the 1882 act (repealed 1943) will hinge less on immediate protests than on broader geopolitical realignments and domestic U.S. attitudes toward global mobility.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning U.S. media (e.g., Fox News)**: Presents Trump’s renewed travel ban as a justified, hard-nosed measure that will keep ‘radical Islamic terrorists’ out of the United States and strengthen national security. Echoes the White House framing and foregrounds terror threats while dismissing or omitting civil-rights objections, reflecting a pro-Trump, security-first editorial stance.

- **Left-leaning / progressive U.S. outlets and advocacy-oriented publications (e.g., NBC News, ABC7, The Siasat Daily)**: Frame the ban as discriminatory and xenophobic, highlighting protests, humanitarian groups’ condemnation and the impact on refugees and families from the affected nations. Emphasises human-rights critiques and immigrant stories while giving comparatively little weight to the administration’s security rationale, aligning with liberal immigration politics.

- **International wire and public broadcasters (e.g., Reuters, BBC)**: Report the ban’s implementation, list affected countries and note diplomatic retaliation (e.g., Chad), legal challenges and mixed U.S. political reaction, treating it as a consequential foreign-policy development. While striving for straight news coverage, reliance on official statements and highlighting global pushback can subtly cast the policy as controversial or damaging to U.S. diplomacy.
