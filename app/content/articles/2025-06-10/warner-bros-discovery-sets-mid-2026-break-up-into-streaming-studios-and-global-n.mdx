# Warner Bros. Discovery Sets Mid-2026 Break-Up Into ‘Streaming & Studios’ and ‘Global Networks’

On 9 June 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery said it will split itself into two separately listed companies—one holding HBO/Warner Bros./DC and the Max service, the other housing CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery—with the transaction targeted to close by mid-2026.

#### Focusing Facts

- WBD shares jumped as much as 12 % in early trading on 9 June 2025 immediately after the announcement.

- The soon-to-be ‘Global Networks’ company will retain up to a 20 % stake in the new streaming entity to help pay down WBD’s roughly $38 billion debt load.

- CEO David Zaslav will run the Streaming & Studios firm while CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels shifts to CEO of Global Networks after the split.

#### Context

Big media has been here before. AOL’s $165 billion takeover of Time Warner in 2001—unwound by 2009—echoes today’s unravelling of yet another ‘synergy’ bet gone sour. Viacom’s 1999 merger with CBS, split in 2006, then recombined in 2019, shows how conglomerates oscillate between scale and focus as technology resets distribution economics. WBD’s move reflects a secular pattern: each distribution revolution—radio networks in the 1920s, broadcast TV in the 1950s, cable in the 1980s, and now streaming—first spurs empire-building, then forces surgical carve-outs once growth stalls and capital markets demand clarity and cash flow. By hiving off declining linear channels that still throw off cash, WBD can court future buyers (private equity or telecoms) while letting a slimmer content/streaming vehicle pursue riskier growth or a merger of its own. Whether this improves consumer offerings or merely rearranges liabilities is debatable, but on a 100-year horizon it is another waypoint in the century-long cycle of aggregation and disaggregation that has defined U.S. media—from the 1943 NBC–Blue Network divestiture that birthed ABC to the coming, likely resale of legacy cable assets as the internet’s unbundling grinds on.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Financial and business press (Bloomberg Business, CNBC, Yahoo Finance)**: See the separation as a strategic, shareholder-friendly move that will give each unit sharper focus and unlock value in a fast-changing streaming market, noting a double-digit stock pop and management’s claims of newfound flexibility. By largely echoing corporate talking points and emphasizing market reaction, they may under-scrutinize execution risks and the hefty debt load that forced the breakup in the first place.

Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-stock-pops-as-company-confirms-it-will-split-into-two-companies-141412619.html))

- **Entertainment-industry trade publications (Deadline, Variety)**: Frame the move as the latest, almost inevitable chapter in a broader wave of legacy-media restructurings meant to keep pace with cord-cutting and position assets for future M&A. Reliant on studio access and insider quotes, their coverage tends to spotlight industry strategy and deal-making upside while giving scant attention to job cuts or consumer impact.

- **Conservative commentary outlets (Washington Free Beacon)**: Portray the split chiefly as an admission that left-leaning CNN is a floundering liability whose plunging ratings are forcing corporate parents to quarantine the brand. Uses selective audience metrics and partisan language to fit a broader narrative of liberal-media failure, overlooking that all legacy cable channels—conservative and liberal—face similar structural decline.
