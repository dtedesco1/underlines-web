# Trump Sets Aug 1 Snap-Back Deadline and Slaps 25 % Tariffs on Japan & South Korea

Three days before his earlier July 9 cut-off, the White House pushed the tariff reset to 1 August and began issuing formal letters imposing 25 % duties, starting with Japan and South Korea.

#### Focusing Facts

- Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN and Fox on 6 July that countries without deals will revert to the original 2 April tariff schedule—10 % to 50 %—effective 1 August.

- President Trump publicly released letters on 7 July ordering 25 % levies on all Japanese and South-Korean imports beginning 1 August, just after markets opened.

- So far only the U.K. and Vietnam have concluded agreements; the EU faces a threatened 50 % rate if no accord emerges this week.

#### Context

Great-power tariff shocks are hardly new: the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act raised U.S. duties on 20,000 items and deepened the Depression, while Nixon’s 10 % ‘import surcharge’ of August 1971—lifted after four months—forced trading partners to the Plaza Hotel talks on currencies. Trump’s rolling deadlines mimic those precedents: create leverage through uncertainty, then trade relief for concessions. The bigger story is the erosion of the post-1995 WTO rules-based system and a drift toward bilateral, conditional market access—echoing the pre-GATT era of ad-hoc deals. Whether these August letters stick or slide again matters less than the signal: the world’s largest consumer market is ready to weaponize tariffs for strategic aims (including counter-BRICS alignment), accelerating the splintering of supply chains that has been underway since the 2018-19 U.S.–China trade war and COVID re-shoring drives. On a century horizon this episode may read as one more waypoint in the slow unravelling of hyper-globalization, analogous to 1914 or 1971 inflection points, rather than a decisive break—unless, like Smoot-Hawley, it triggers retaliatory spirals that institutional fixes cannot absorb.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: Portray the shifting tariff deadlines as evidence of Trump’s chaotic trade strategy that is sowing uncertainty for governments, companies and markets. Coverage often foregrounds confusion and economic risk, likely amplifying any signs of disorder while giving scant attention to potential negotiating successes Trump officials cite. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/06/trump-tariff-delay), [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-tariffs-deadline-letters-sent-to-trade-partners-what-to-know-rcna217183))

- **Right leaning media**: Presents the delayed August-1 tariff snap-back as a savvy pressure tactic that maximises U.S. leverage and is already driving foreign partners toward last-minute deals. Reporting tends to celebrate the president’s hard-line stance and minimise the possible downside for consumers and markets, reflecting a generally pro-Trump editorial slant.

- **Financial market outlets**: Focus on how the moving deadlines and tariff letters are dampening risk appetite, pushing metal prices lower and leaving investors and consumers unsure about future costs. Articles centre on market volatility and spending surveys, a lens that can overstate short-term market drama while giving limited context on the broader geopolitical goals behind the tariffs.
