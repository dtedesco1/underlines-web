# Jack Dorsey Releases Beta of ‘Bitchat’ Offline Bluetooth-Mesh Messaging App

On 7 July 2025, Jack Dorsey quietly pushed a public iOS TestFlight beta of Bitchat—an open-source, server-less chat platform that moves messages only via Bluetooth mesh hops.

#### Focusing Facts

- The TestFlight beta went live 7 July 2025 and immediately hit Apple’s 10,000-user testing cap within 24 hours.

- Bitchat’s protocol operates in 30 m BLE hops, with multi-hop relays extending practical range to roughly 300 m, according to the white paper.

- Dorsey simultaneously published a 22-page technical white paper and full source code on GitHub under an open licence.

#### Context

Offline, device-to-device networks have surfaced whenever central channels looked fragile—from the 1930s clandestine leaflets in occupied Europe to Hong Kong protesters’ 2019 Bridgefy Bluetooth chats. Bitchat fits that lineage: a bid to route around chokepoints and surveillance by removing infrastructure altogether, echoing FidoNet’s hobbyist dial-up meshes of the 1980s and early Tor onion routing (2002) that prized decentralisation over convenience. In the longer arc, the app underscores two converging megatrends: the hardening of state and corporate control over data pipes, and the parallel push toward user-owned, censorship-resistant protocols (Bitcoin 2009, Mastodon 2016). Whether Bitchat itself survives or fades like earlier experiments matters less than the precedent it sets: each technical proof-of-concept makes ‘network optional’ communication more credible. A century from now, historians may see 2020s mesh tools as early steps toward resilient, post-infrastructure information systems—useful in disasters, authoritarian crack-downs, or even interplanetary settings—much as we now view early packet-switched ARPANET nodes of 1969.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Crypto-focused media (Cointelegraph, CryptoSlate)**: They hail Bitchat as proof that fully decentralized, censorship-resistant messaging is already feasible and could thrive anywhere the internet is blocked. Ideologically invested in Web3 and decentralization, these outlets emphasize the upside and gloss over Bluetooth’s range limits and the app’s untested scalability.

- **Mainstream business and financial press (CNBC, The Economic Times, Business Standard)**: They frame the app as Jack Dorsey’s latest experiment that could eventually rival WhatsApp by offering off-grid, privacy-centric communication. Eager for a disruptive business narrative, they lean on Dorsey’s celebrity and may overstate the app’s competitive threat despite its weekend-project maturity.

- **Consumer tech blogs and regional tech outlets (BetaNews, Digit, The Times of India)**: They spotlight the gadget appeal—messaging without internet—touting usefulness at concerts, disasters or protests and noting the beta’s instant signup cap. Feature-driven coverage can drift into hype, downplaying security caveats and the practicality of Bluetooth mesh for everyday users.
