# Modi Celebrates ISRO’s 100th Launch, Ignites Youth Science Drive

On February 23, 2025, PM Modi, in his 119th Mann Ki Baat, celebrated ISRO's milestone 100th rocket launch and introduced the 'One Day as a Scientist' initiative to spur scientific curiosity among youth.

#### Focusing Facts

- ISRO marked its 100th rocket launch in January 2025, including a record mission launching 104 satellites at once.

- PM Modi urged citizens to spend a day as a scientist for National Science Day on February 28, 2025, and highlighted AI advancements and women's empowerment initiatives.

- ISRO’s achievements over the past 10 years include launching approximately 460 satellites, with increasing participation of women in the sector.

#### Context

This event reflects a pivotal moment not just in India's space program but in its broader push towards scientific inclusivity and innovation. Similar to historical landmarks like the Apollo Moon landing in 1969, which stirred global public imagination and redefined science and technology paradigms, Modi’s address underscores a shift from elite-driven research to mainstream participation. By linking space milestones with grassroots science initiatives and digital innovation—illustrated by AI projects preserving indigenous languages—the event signals a long-term strategic move. Over the next century, this approach may reshape how citizens perceive science and technology, transforming national identity and fostering a resilient ecosystem that is prepared for the multifaceted challenges of the global future.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business and Technology Media**: They portray the event as a clear sign of India’s unprecedented technological and scientific progress, emphasizing ISRO’s 100th launch as a symbol of national growth and global leadership in AI and space exploration. These outlets tend to echo government narratives and focus on the positive implications for business and innovation while overlooking any policy challenges or alternative viewpoints.
