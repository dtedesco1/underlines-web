# China Overtakes South Korea in Semiconductor Tech, Survey Shows

A 2025 survey by 39 domestic experts at KISTEP reveals that South Korea now trails China in key semiconductor technologies, a stark reversal from 2022 standings.

#### Focusing Facts

- In memory technology, South Korea scored 90.9% compared to China’s 94.1%.

- For AI semiconductors, South Korea achieved 84.1% while China reached 88.3%.

- The survey indicates SK now lags in four out of five core semiconductor areas, with advanced packaging being the only tie.

#### Context

This shift mirrors historical realignments where established innovators were overtaken by determined rivals, much like the rise of American dominance over Britain’s industrial leadership in the early 20th century. The rapid catch-up by China since 2022 reflects deeper systemic trends: aggressive investment in advanced manufacturing, evolving geopolitical trade dynamics, and strategic policy decisions. While short-term news cycles might portray this as a setback for South Korea, similar long-term transitions in technological leadership have redefined global competitive paradigms for over a century. This moment, though acute, is part of a broader cycle of innovation and geopolitical repositioning that reshapes national economic and security strategies over the long haul.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Conservative Korean Press**: They interpret South Korea’s lag in semiconductor technology as a national crisis, highlighting political and bureaucratic failures that have allowed China to surge ahead. This group may overemphasize governmental incompetence and use alarmist language to rally nationalist sentiment, potentially overlooking broader global market trends.

- **Technically Focused Mainstream Media**: They present the survey findings as a data-driven shift in semiconductor competitiveness, emphasizing the need for continued technological investment and innovation without overt political framing. This group may underplay the political context and local economic challenges, focusing primarily on technical factors while omitting broader strategic implications.
