# Trump’s Riyadh Pivot: Criticizes Zelenskyy & Paves Way for Russia-Backed Peace

In high-stakes Riyadh talks on February 19-20, President Trump aggressively denounced Ukrainian President Zelenskyy while promoting controversial peace proposals that favor Russian demands.

#### Focusing Facts

- On February 19, Trump labeled Zelenskyy a 'dictator without elections' and claimed Ukraine incited a $350bn war.

- US officials, including envoys Keith Kellogg and Mike Waltz, floated a deal that would see Ukraine handing over up to $500bn in mineral assets for security guarantees.

- G7 leaders are in dispute over calling Russia an 'aggressor,' underscoring the new US posture in framing the conflict.

#### Context

This development echoes historical moments of controversial appeasement, reminiscent of the 1938 Munich Agreement where Western leaders compromised with aggressors in the hope of avoiding war—albeit at enduring strategic costs. Trump's pivot, marked by his previous outreach to autocrats like Kim Jong-un in 2018, reflects a broader long-term realignment that sidesteps traditional alliances and democratic norms. On a centennial scale, such shifts may redefine global power structures, undermine the post-World War II security order, and signal a departure from established norms that have underpinned European stability for decades.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning media**: They praise Trump as a decisive, peace-seeking leader willing to challenge Western norms and prioritize negotiation even if it means acknowledging Russia’s security concerns. This perspective tends to dismiss established alliances and critiques of Trump as overblown, likely driven by ideological conservatism and a tendency to valorize Trump’s unorthodox methods.

- **Mainstream pro-Ukraine/left-leaning media**: They portray Trump’s rhetoric as dangerously misleading and harmful, accusing him of aligning with Russian disinformation and undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty and Western unity. This perspective may emphasize the moral and strategic failures of Trump’s approach, often reflecting a commitment to established alliances and a skepticism toward any rapprochement that appears to legitimize Russian actions.
