# Zelensky’s NATO Ultimatum Amid Trump-Putin Diplomatic Overture

On February 23, 2025, as the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion looms, Ukrainian President Zelensky offers to resign in exchange for NATO membership, while Trump’s outreach and high-level talks with Putin signal a potential realignment in the conflict.

#### Focusing Facts

- Putin declared a divine mandate for defending Russia and launched a record 267 drone strikes on Ukraine in one night.

- Zelensky announced his readiness to immediately step down if it ensures Ukraine’s NATO membership.

- US-Russian diplomatic engagements in Saudi Arabia and ongoing meetings hint at a strategic shift, despite Moscow’s refusal to cede occupied territories.

#### Context

This moment echoes the high-stakes negotiations of the Cold War era, such as during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, where personal risk and diplomatic brinkmanship were intertwined with broader ideological conflicts. The convergence of ultimatums over NATO, symbolic gestures like divine rhetoric, and new engagement tactics by leaders such as Trump reflect long-term trends towards recalibrated alliances and proxy contests. In a century marked by shifting power balances, these developments underscore how individual political gambits, however dramatic, are interwoven into enduring systems of territorial and security disputes.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Kremlin-aligned media**: These articles present the conflict as a divinely sanctioned mission and defend Russia’s territorial claims by invoking popular votes and rejecting any territorial concessions. They tend to frame Russian actions as both inevitable and righteous, downplaying aggressive military actions and promoting state-approved narratives.

- **Western and Ukrainian-focused media**: These pieces report on Zelensky’s offer to resign in exchange for NATO membership as a bold political maneuver to secure Western support and counter Trump's dismissive rhetoric. They emphasize dramatic political theatrics and the urgency of Ukrainian security needs, potentially overstating the benefits of Western backing while downplaying complex diplomatic realities.
