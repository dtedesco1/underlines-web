# Eskom Escalates to Stage 6 Load Shedding Amid Power Station Unit Trips

On Feb 22-23, 2025, Eskom abruptly escalated from Stage 3 to Stage 6 load shedding at 1:30 a.m. following multiple unit trips and major planned maintenance, reversing a recent period of stability.

#### Focusing Facts

- Stage 6 load shedding was implemented at 1:30 a.m. on February 23, 2025.

- A unit trip at Medupi caused a loss of 3,864 MW while planned maintenance took 7,506 MW offline.

- A media briefing was scheduled for 11:00 a.m. on February 23, 2025 to provide further updates.

#### Context

The abrupt transition to Stage 6 load shedding recalls past systemic crises, such as Eskom’s own challenges in the late 2000s and global events like the 2003 Northeast blackout in the US, where sudden failures exposed underlying infrastructure vulnerabilities. This event reinforces the long-standing tension between maintaining reserve capacity and addressing aging power plant issues, highlighting how a period of uninterrupted supply can quickly give way to operational stress. Over a century, power utilities worldwide have struggled to balance efficiency with reliability; without strategic reforms and energy diversification, such episodes not only disrupt daily life but can also deter long-term economic investment and signal deeper systemic challenges.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Official Utility and Government Media**: This group explains that the implementation of Stage 6 load shedding is a technical and necessary response to power station trips and maintenance requirements, aimed at replenishing emergency reserves and preparing for future demand. They tend to emphasize technical justifications and downplay broader systemic or mismanagement issues, potentially to defend Eskom’s track record and maintain public confidence.

- **Political Critics and Public Dissent**: This group interprets the escalation to Stage 6 load shedding as a symptom of government mismanagement and a failure to properly warn citizens, particularly embarrassing amid international scrutiny. They may overemphasize political blame and crisis narratives to undermine current leadership and push for alternative policy changes, influenced by political opposition sentiments.
