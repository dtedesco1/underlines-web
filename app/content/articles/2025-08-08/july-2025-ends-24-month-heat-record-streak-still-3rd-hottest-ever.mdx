# July 2025 Ends 24-Month Heat-Record Streak, Still 3rd-Hottest Ever

Copernicus data show July 2025 averaged 1.25 °C above pre-industrial levels—cooler than 2023-24 peaks, breaking a two-year run of monthly records—yet extreme floods and 50 °C heatwaves persisted.

#### Focusing Facts

- Copernicus calculated a mean surface air temperature of 16.68 °C for July 2025, 0.45 °C above the 1991-2020 July average.

- Rolling Aug 2024–Jul 2025 global mean hit 1.53 °C above 1850-1900 baseline, breaching the Paris-agreement 1.5 °C ceiling for a full 12-month stretch.

- Turkey set an all-time national high of 50.5 °C on 25 July while battling wildfires.

#### Context

Climate numbers seldom make headlines unless they shatter records, yet history shows the pauses between spikes are fleeting: after the 1998 El Niño cooled slightly, 2005 and 2010 swiftly set new highs. July 2025 resembles that 1998 lull—a temporary dip that still left temperatures well above the 20th-century norm, echoing how the 1936 U.S. Dust Bowl summer gave way to even hotter decades. The event underscores two structural trends: 1) inexorable anthropogenic greenhouse-gas accumulation now pushing the 12-month mean beyond the Paris 1.5 °C guardrail, and 2) the coupling of ocean heat (third-warmest July sea-surface) with amplified hydrologic extremes, evident in simultaneous 50 °C Middle-East heat and South-Asian floods. On a century horizon, this moment will matter less for the rank—third-warmest will soon be routine—than for marking when humanity first sustained a year above the Paris threshold, a statistical milestone that future climate negotiators and historians may treat as the point when warnings became measurable overshoot.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International wire services and mainstream Western outlets (AP News, San Francisco Gate, Spectrum News, CityNews Toronto)**: They underline that despite a brief dip, July 2025 was still 1.25°C above pre-industrial levels and warn that deeper cuts to greenhouse-gas emissions are essential to prevent ever-worse climate extremes. Highlighting scientists’ warnings and the Paris 1.5 °C benchmark reinforces the urgency of climate policy favoured by many Western governments and may downplay economic costs or scientific uncertainties.

- **Middle-East regional media (Gulf News, Arab News, Daily Sabah)**: Coverage focuses on the Gulf and Türkiye smashing 50 °C records, floods in Pakistan and China, and stresses that climate change remains a threat even though July slipped to only the third-hottest on record. Outlets from fossil-fuel-exporting states acknowledge warming but discuss it in broad terms, avoiding detailed scrutiny of how their own oil and gas sectors drive the crisis, thereby muting calls for local decarbonisation.

- **Right-leaning British tabloid press (Daily Mail Online)**: The story notes that the ‘recent streak of global temperature records is over – for now,’ stressing the lower ranking of this July as the third-warmest after two hotter years. By foregrounding the temporary dip and surrounding wire copy with sensational imagery, the paper can subtly play into readers’ skepticism toward sweeping climate regulations, even while technically relaying the scientific consensus.
