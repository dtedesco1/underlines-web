# EU: July 2025 Is Third-Warmest, Ending Nearly Two-Year Monthly Record Streak

After almost two years of record monthly global averages, July 2025 cooled slightly to 1.25°C above the 1850–1900 baseline, ending the run even as the Aug 2024–Jul 2025 period remained at 1.53°C above preindustrial levels.

#### Focusing Facts

- On July 25, 2025, Turkey set a national heat record of 50.5°C amid ongoing wildfires.

- July’s global mean surface air temperature reached 16.68°C, which is 0.45°C above the 1991–2020 average.

- Arctic sea ice extent was ~10% below average, the second-lowest July in 47 years of satellite observations.

#### Context

Seen against the long arc, this looks less like a turning point and more like the familiar post–El Niño breather—akin to the cool-downs after the 1997–98 and 2015–16 El Niños—rather than a reversal of warming. Copernicus’ ERA5 reanalysis (global coverage since 1940) underpins the ranking, and while different datasets (NOAA, NASA, HadCRUT) may shuffle exact positions, they converge on the same picture: a structurally warming climate punctuated by short-term variability from ENSO, changing aerosols (e.g., shipping sulfur curbs since 2020), and even the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption’s water vapor injection. The spatial split—cooler-than-normal patches in the Americas and India alongside record heat in parts of Asia and the Nordics, plus severe floods and fires—signals an intensifying hydrological cycle rather than a uniform fever. On a 100-year timescale, a single “third-warmest” month matters less than the stubborn 12‑month anomaly above 1.5°C, relentless ocean heat uptake (~90% of excess energy), and declining summer sea ice: system-level shifts that will shape infrastructure lifetimes, food and water security, and coastal risk for generations, irrespective of any brief statistical reprieves.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **AFP-syndicated international outlets (e.g., Gulf News, The Manila Times, Arab News)**: Frames the small dip from recent records as misleading and highlights widespread “climate havoc”—floods, wildfires, sea-ice loss—explicitly linking impacts to fossil-fuel emissions and warning that records will be broken again without rapid cuts. Uses urgent wording and impact-heavy examples (e.g., 50C+ heat, catastrophic floods, explicit call to “rapidly stabilise” greenhouse gases), which emphasizes alarm and near-term risk to spur attention to climate action.

- **AP wire and reprints (e.g., AP News, SFGate, CityNews Toronto, Spectrum News, Daily Mail Online, ynetnews, Daily Sabah)**: Reports Copernicus findings that July 2025 was the third-warmest on record, noting the record streak is over “for now,” reiterating greenhouse gases as the main cause while stressing that extremes continue despite a slight dip. Centers institutional data and quotes and underscores the “for now” caveat without delving into policy responses, which can make urgency feel tempered relative to impact-led coverage.
