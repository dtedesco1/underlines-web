# Putin Meets Trump Envoy Witkoff as Aug. 8 Ceasefire Ultimatum Nears

Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow and held Kremlin talks days before Trump’s Aug. 8 deadline, with Moscow signaling a possible limited “air truce” that would pause missile/drone strikes on cities while leaving Russia’s ground campaign and advances untouched, amid U.S. threats of secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian oil.

#### Focusing Facts

- After a Trump–Zelensky call, the U.S. approved $200 million in additional military sales to Ukraine on Tuesday.

- Russia gained about 886 square miles from late December to end-June, according to ISW mapping.

- The UN recorded more than 6,700 Ukrainian civilian deaths in the first half of 2025.

#### Context

This looks less like a breakthrough than a familiar effort to freeze parts of the battlefield—closer to Minsk II (2015) than a true peace—by curbing air strikes while consolidating territorial gains, as Russia did after the 2008 Georgia war and in eastern Ukraine post-2014. Washington’s gambit leans on economic coercion reminiscent of U.S. pressure during the 1956 Suez Crisis and the 2012–2015 Iran sanctions, but today’s multipolar energy networks (India/China as key buyers; BRICS+ finance) blunt Western leverage and reward sanctions-proofing. An “air-only” ceasefire would reduce civilian massacre risk yet constrain Ukraine’s drone deterrent, potentially locking in a grinding attritional war. Over a 100‑year horizon, this moment tests whether weaponized trade and tariffs can still shape major-power wars in a fragmented global system—and whether drone-era norms emerge that separate urban protection from frontline dynamics, or merely institutionalize frozen conflicts with periodic escalation.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western mainstream media**: They depict Putin as unlikely to concede a full ceasefire, possibly dangling a limited air-truce that halts strikes on cities while maintaining battlefield gains, and stress the need for tougher sanctions/tariffs to raise Russia’s costs. They foreground Russian attacks on civilians and stress Witkoff’s inexperience and Kremlin-friendly rhetoric, reinforcing skepticism toward Trump’s envoy and framing diplomacy as faltering.

- **Russian state media**: They frame the Kremlin meeting as constructive high-level engagement, argue U.S. sanctions threats lack legal basis, and reiterate that Russia prefers diplomacy but won’t compromise on national security against a NATO‑aligned neighbor. They echo official Kremlin messaging about ‘mutual benefits’ from engagement and challenge the legitimacy of sanctions, aligning coverage with Moscow’s narratives.

- **Right-wing U.S. alternative media**: They suggest Moscow’s overtures may be a delay tactic and warn that secondary sanctions could backfire given BRICS cohesion and India’s refusal to distance from Russia. They highlight limits of U.S. leverage and portray sanctions as ineffective, reflecting a pro‑Trump, anti‑sanctions framing.
