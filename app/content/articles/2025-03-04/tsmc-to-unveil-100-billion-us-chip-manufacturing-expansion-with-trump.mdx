# TSMC to Unveil $100 Billion U.S. Chip Manufacturing Expansion with Trump

On March 3, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei meets President Trump at the White House to announce a $100 billion investment in new chip fabs across the U.S., deepening its Arizona footprint over the next 3-4 years.

#### Focusing Facts

- TSMC plans to build five state-of-the-art fabrication facilities in Arizona, potentially creating up to 25,000 jobs.

- This $100 billion move follows prior commitments that grew from a $12 billion start in 2020 to a $65 billion expansion, backed by a $6.6 billion U.S. subsidy.

- The announcement comes amid Trump's push for tariffs of 25%-100% on foreign semiconductors to bolster domestic production.

#### Context

TSMC's massive U.S. investment echoes historical episodes like the 1958 U.S. drive to cultivate domestic defense and aerospace production during the Cold War, when state and industry collaborations redefined national economic security. As global supply chains have long been tilted towards Asia, this initiative reflects a systemic shift reminiscent of past industrial rebalancing efforts, such as during the 1970s energy crisis. Over the long term, while technology continuously transforms industrial landscapes, strategic moves to secure critical technology production mark pivotal turning points that could redefine the global economic order for the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: They frame TSMC's $100 billion investment as a vindication of Trump's America-first economic and national security policies, emphasizing tariffs and the reshoring of manufacturing to curb foreign dependence. This group tends to overstate the role of nationalist rhetoric and downplays the complex factors such as bipartisan support and existing long-term business strategies behind TSMCâ€™s expansion.

- **Left leaning media**: They interpret the investment as part of a broader, bipartisan effort to secure and modernize the U.S. semiconductor supply chain, highlighting government subsidies like the Chips Act and existing global market trends. This group may underemphasize the nationalist and protectionist language employed by political figures, instead focusing on economic and strategic factors with a tendency to blur the lines between political rhetoric and business imperatives.
