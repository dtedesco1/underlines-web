# US Set to Reactivate Nuclear Mission at RAF Lakenheath

Evidence from budget documents, satellite imagery, and infrastructure upgrades confirms that since 2022 the USAF is preparing RAF Lakenheath for a potential nuclear surety mission amid escalating tensions with Russia.

#### Focusing Facts

- Upgrades to 28 of 33 protective aircraft shelters with WS3 underground vaults began in 2022 at RAF Lakenheath.

- A 2023 USAF budget document detailed construction of a 'surety dormitory' to accommodate increased nuclear weapons specialist training.

- RAF Lakenheath, which previously hosted nuclear-capable bombers until their withdrawal in 2007, is now the sole base with proper infrastructure for this mission.

#### Context

This development echoes Cold War-era shifts in nuclear deployment; for instance, RAF Lakenheath once housed nuclear-capable B-29s and B-47s in the 1950s before a post-Cold War pullback. Today’s renewal, spurred by heightened geopolitical risks since Russia’s invasions of Ukraine (2014 and 2022), reflects long-standing trends of rebalancing deterrence strategies in response to emerging threats. While past initiatives like the 1963 test ban treaty marked a significant de-escalation in nuclear arms activity, the current move—with tangible infrastructure investments—signals that nuclear strategies remain dynamic and subject to rapid recalibration. Over a century, such strategic pivots have reshaped international power balances and will continue to influence nuclear policy debates and alliance structures in an era where deterrence and technological evolution converge.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US/NATO Military Analysts**: They interpret the potential reactivation of nuclear missions, such as at RAF Lakenheath, as a necessary strategic adjustment in response to escalating threats from adversaries like Russia. This perspective may underplay the risks of nuclear escalation and focuses on deterrence, influenced by a defense establishment mindset.

- **Anti-Nuclear Activists**: They view moves toward resuming nuclear weapons tests as a dangerous step that risks public health and could reignite an arms race. This stance is likely influenced by a focus on historical test ban successes and may overemphasize the negative fallout risks while underestimating deterrence arguments.

- **European Security Critics**: They argue that if the US withdraws its military support, Europe will be compelled to develop its own nuclear capabilities, exposing vulnerabilities in transatlantic defense. This narrative may be shaped by concerns over US commitment to NATO and prompts a focus on European self-reliance that might exaggerate imminent threats.
