# Zelensky Insists on Ukraine-Driven Peace Talks as Trump-Putin Dialogue Sparks European Security Debate

At the Munich Security Conference on February 14-15, Ukrainian President Zelensky declared that any peace negotiations with Russia must include a joint plan with the US and Europe, countering Trump’s early talks with Putin and US signals of potential military leverage.

#### Focusing Facts

- On February 14, 2025, Zelensky stated he will meet only with Putin when a joint plan with US and European leaders is in place, doubling Ukraine’s military force to 1.5 million if NATO membership is not achieved.

- US Vice President JD Vance warned that if Russia stalls a deal, both economic sanctions and military tools could pressure Moscow, amid Trump’s recent 90-minute call with Putin signaling early concessions.

- Forbes confirmed that despite circulating billionaire rumors, Zelensky’s net worth remains around $20-$30 million, highlighting his modest personal assets.

#### Context

Historically, peace negotiations that exclude key affected parties—such as the 1970s SALT talks during the Cold War—often led to unstable agreements and long-term regional imbalances. This event underscores a shifting international security framework where traditional power alliances are in flux: the US, under Trump’s unconventional approach, appears ready to negotiate with Russia, while European leaders and Ukraine demand a more robust, inclusive settlement to ensure sovereignty. On a centennial scale, this reflects the ongoing struggle to redefine global security architectures in the post-Cold War era, where past templates of exclusive superpower diplomacy are increasingly replaced by multipolar demands for shared decision-making and regional burden-sharing.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European pro-Ukraine media**: They insist that Ukraine must be at the center of any peace negotiations, warning that sidelining Kyiv only cedes ground to Russian influence and undermines European security. This perspective tends to emphasize NATO unity and Ukrainian sovereignty, possibly underplaying broader strategic or diplomatic pressures faced by Western leaders.

- **US defense establishment and Trump administration advocates**: They argue that engaging Russia through negotiations—even if it means proceeding with plans that limit Ukraine’s role—is a strategic necessity to rebalance US priorities toward challenges like East Asia. This view may downplay the importance of Ukrainian agency in its own peace process and can be influenced by a desire to reassign burden-sharing in ways that align with nationalist and pragmatic US interests.
