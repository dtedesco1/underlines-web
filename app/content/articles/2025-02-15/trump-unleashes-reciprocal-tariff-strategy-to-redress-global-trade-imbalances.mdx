# Trump Unleashes Reciprocal Tariff Strategy to Redress Global Trade Imbalances

On February 13, 2025, President Trump signed a memorandum marking a shift to aggressive reciprocal tariffs, setting in motion a 180-day review to mirror foreign tariff practices and trade barriers.

#### Focusing Facts

- The memorandum instructs Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade representative Jamieson Greer to assess each major U.S. trading partner's practices, with reports due within 180 days.

- The plan targets countries imposing higher tariffs and non-tariff measures, with specific attention to sectors like steel, aluminum, and automobiles, and mentions using reciprocal actions against nations including the EU, India, and Thailand.

- It builds on earlier measures such as a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and delayed 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and broader imports.

#### Context

This development echoes historic protectionist moves such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of the 1930s, highlighting how economic nationalism can reframe global trade rules. Unlike past decades, when tariff adjustments followed lengthy investigations, this rapid, retaliatory strategy directly challenges established multilateral trade norms. In a century marked by the rise of free trade and the creation of global institutions like the WTO, Trump's approach signifies a potential long-term shift that could destabilize established international agreements and reshape economic power dynamics for generations to come.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International analytical media (BBC)**: This group offers a more nuanced analysis of Trumpâ€™s tariff policy, questioning its effectiveness and highlighting the complexity of matching tariffs across diverse trading systems. Their balanced approach may understate the political intent behind the tariffs while focusing on technical and economic complexities rather than underlying power dynamics.
