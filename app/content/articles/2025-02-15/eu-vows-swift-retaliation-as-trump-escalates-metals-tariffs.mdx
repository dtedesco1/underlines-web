# EU Vows Swift Retaliation as Trump Escalates Metals Tariffs

On February 10-11, Trump's administration announced a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports to take effect on March 12, triggering immediate retaliatory threats from the EU.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump declared 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum effective March 12, removing previous exemptions.

- EU officials, including Ursula von der Leyen and Olaf Scholz, pledged firm countermeasures targeting US exports like motorcycles, bourbon, and jeans.

- The administration also signaled potential tariffs on goods from allies like Canada, Mexico, and China, escalating the trade dispute.

#### Context

This episode echoes earlier cycles of tariff escalation, reminiscent of both the EU’s previous retaliatory measures during Trump's first term (when counter-tariffs targeted about €2.8bn in US goods) and even earlier protectionist trends like those seen after the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. Such actions underline long-standing tensions in global trade where unilateral tariff impositions trigger reciprocal measures, disrupting established economic interdependencies. Over a century, these cycles have repeatedly reshaped trade politics and economic policies, often at significant long-term cost to both sides. Today’s developments reflect systemic challenges facing transatlantic trade relations, reminding global stakeholders that protectionist strategies, while politically expedient, tend to foster enduring economic volatility.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European Union Establishment Media**: These sources present Trump's tariffs as unjustified measures that imperil the economic interdependence between the US and the EU, insisting that any such tariffs will trigger immediate and united European countermeasures to protect their industries and consumers. They may understate the disruptive impact on European economies while emphasizing the need for solidarity and counter-retaliation, potentially downplaying any shortcomings in their own policy responses.

- **US Nationalist/Protectionist Media**: These sources describe the tariffs as straightforward and decisive actions by Trump aimed at reviving American manufacturing and protecting domestic jobs by leveling the trading field. They tend to focus on the benefits of protecting domestic industries and often overlook the risks of retaliatory measures or the broader costs of trade wars on the global economy.
