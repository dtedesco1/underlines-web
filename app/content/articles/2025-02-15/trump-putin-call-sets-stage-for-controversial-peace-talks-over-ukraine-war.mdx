# Trump-Putin Call Sets Stage for Controversial Peace Talks Over Ukraine War

On February 12, 2025, President Trump announced a 90-minute phone call with President Putin where both leaders agreed to immediately start negotiations over the Ukraine war, sidelining Ukrainian input.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump reported a 90-minute call with Putin on February 12, 2025, agreeing to start negotiations with appointed US team members.

- US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared that restoring Ukraine's pre-2014 borders and a NATO membership are 'not realistic', effectively accepting territorial concessions.

- European leaders and President Zelenskyy voiced strong opposition to negotiations excluding Ukraine, stressing that any deal must center on Ukrainian sovereignty.

#### Context

This event echoes historical episodes like Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement at Munich in 1938 and the Yalta Conference of 1945, where major concessions were made by powerful nations at the expense of smaller states. Trump's unilateral move to bypass traditional diplomatic channels and begin negotiations with Russia reflects a significant shift in American foreign policy, potentially altering long-established security frameworks in Eastern Europe. On a centennial scale, such decisions risk undermining the post-World War II international order, reminding us that every act of conciliatory diplomacy can reconfigure power dynamics and reshape alliances for generations.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: They portray Trump's call with Putin as a bold diplomatic move that sets negotiations in motion to stop the ongoing violence in Ukraine and prevent further loss of life. This perspective may understate the risks of negotiating without robust safeguards for Ukraine and could overlook the possibility that concessions might embolden Russia.

- **Left leaning/European establishment media**: They decry the decision to engage directly with Putin as appeasement, arguing that Trump’s concessions undermine Ukraine’s security and betray Western commitments. This view might overemphasize the negatives of negotiating with Russia and be driven by a commitment to uphold traditional Western alliances and historical lessons against appeasement.
