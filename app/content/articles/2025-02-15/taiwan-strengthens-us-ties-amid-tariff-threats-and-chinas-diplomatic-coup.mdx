# Taiwan Strengthens U.S. Ties Amid Tariff Threats and China's Diplomatic Coup

In February 2025, Taiwan announced plans to boost defense spending and ramp up U.S. investments, responding to Trump’s tariff threats and a renewed Chinese diplomatic campaign aimed at unifying the island by force.

#### Focusing Facts

- 70 Global South countries now support hardline language endorsing China’s efforts to unify Taiwan.

- Taiwan plans to raise its defense spending from 2.45% to 3% of GDP and has over 40% of its overseas investments directed to the U.S.

- Trump's administration threatened up to 100% tariffs on Taiwanese semiconductor imports, impacting TSMC’s 64.9% share of the global foundry market.

#### Context

This multifaceted event recalls Cold War dynamics such as the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, where strategic balancing and diplomatic signaling played critical roles. Here, Taiwan’s policy shift and increased defense investment, coupled with deeper U.S. economic ties, reflect long-term trends in realignment among great powers and regional security strategies. While Trump’s transactional approach and China's preemptive diplomatic moves echo historical episodes of power recalibration, the current developments set the stage for a potential redefinition of regional stability. On a century-long scale, the interplay of economic interdependence, military deterrence, and shifting global alliances may ultimately reshape the security architecture of the Asia-Pacific region.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning media**: They advocate a robust, America-first approach, arguing that Trump’s tariff threats and trade policies are necessary to counter China and strengthen the US-Taiwan security partnership. This perspective can lean towards oversimplifying complex international relations and favoring strong unilateral actions, reflecting a pro-Trump, hawkish stance.

- **Establishment/centrist analysis**: Broad analyses emphasize China’s diplomatic maneuvers and strategic recalibrations regarding Taiwan, highlighting the complex and multi-layered nature of US-China-Taiwan relations. These outlets may underplay the dramatic rhetoric in favor of nuanced policy discussions, potentially missing populist sentiments or immediate political pressures.

- **Local Taiwan-focused media**: They stress Taiwan’s proactive measures—such as increasing defense spending and boosting US investment—as responses to tariff threats and to secure its strategic standing. This approach may overemphasize Taiwan’s agency and the immediacy of threats to garner support for domestic policies, reflecting national priorities over broader geopolitical constraints.
