# Congress Clears GENIUS Stablecoin Act, First Federal Crypto Law Heads to Trump

On 17 July 2025 the House approved the Senate-passed Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act 308-122, dispatching the first nationwide cryptocurrency statute to President Trump for signature.

#### Focusing Facts

- House vote: 308 yes (all Republicans + 102 Democrats) vs. 122 no; Senate had passed the same bill 68-30 on 18 June with 18 Democratic votes.

- The act sets reserve, disclosure and licensing rules for dollar-pegged stablecoins while potentially benefiting Trump-linked issuer World Liberty Financial’s USD1 token.

- To mollify conservative hold-outs, GOP leaders promised to graft a ban on a Federal Reserve CBDC onto the 2026 NDAA, and the separate CLARITY market-structure bill now moves to a skeptical Senate.

#### Context

Washington has not upended its financial rulebook this decisively since the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley repeal of Glass-Steagall cleared the way for new instruments that later amplified the 2008 crisis.  Today’s vote caps a multi-cycle lobbying blitz—over $130 million in 2024 alone—that echoes the railroads’ sway over the 1860s Congress or the telecom windfalls embedded in the 1996 Telecom Act.  It signals a long arc toward privatized, tech-driven payment systems and away from state-run monetary plumbing begun with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.  Whether stablecoins become the Internet’s cash rails or the next sub-prime mortgage, this moment matters because it embeds crypto into federal statute before a major crash has forced reforms.  Over a 100-year horizon, the bill may mark either the birth of a new monetary layer—akin to banknotes in the 19th century—or a cautionary footnote on the perils of deregulation under heavy campaign spending.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Progressive advocacy media (e.g., Common Dreams)**: Portrays the passage of the GENIUS and related bills as Congress caving to crypto lobby cash and enabling Trump’s personal ‘Ponzi-scheme’ enrichment at the expense of consumers and national security. Relies heavily on statements from advocacy groups and partisan Democrats, uses incendiary language and gives little space to any potential benefits or bipartisan motives mentioned elsewhere.

- **Business-oriented financial press (e.g., Forbes)**: Frames the legislation as a pragmatic step that delivers long-sought regulatory clarity, protects stable-coin holders and positions the U.S. to lead the ‘golden age’ of digital assets. Tends to echo talking points from industry and Republican leaders, accentuates economic opportunity while glossing over conflict-of-interest criticisms and the bill’s dilution of SEC oversight.

- **Mainstream public radio news (NPR)**: Covers the vote as a historic milestone for crypto, noting both the industry’s lobbying victory and critics’ warnings that the rules are too lenient and will enrich Trump. Aims for balance but still prioritizes the political drama and symbolism of the vote, summarizing complex regulatory details and potentially underplaying deeper structural risks.
