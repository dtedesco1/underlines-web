# EU Unveils €72 B Retaliatory Tariff List After Trump’s 30 % Threat

On 15 July 2025 the European Commission published a pared-down 200-page list targeting €72 billion in U.S. exports, signalling it is ready to strike back if President Trump enacts a 30 % blanket duty on EU goods from 1 August.

#### Focusing Facts

- The second-round counter-measure list was cut from an initial €95 billion to €72 billion after company and member-state consultations, hitting Boeing aircraft (~€11 b), cars (~€8 b) and bourbon (€1.2 b).

- Trump’s proposed 30 % baseline tariff, announced 12 July 2025, would escalate the current 10 % level and existing 25 % levy on foreign cars unless a deal is struck before 1 August.

- A separate, already-approved €21 billion EU tariff package—aimed at U.S. steel and aluminium measures—remains suspended until 6 August to leave room for negotiations.

#### Context

Trade brinkmanship between Washington and Brussels echoes the tit-for-tat spiral triggered by the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act, which shrank U.S.–European trade by two-thirds within two years. Today’s clash fits a longer trajectory: the post-1995 rules-based order is fraying as major powers weaponise tariffs to pursue tech, climate and security goals the WTO struggle to adjudicate. The EU’s internal split between market-minded Germany and Trump-sympathetic nationalists highlights how external pressure can expose fissures in supranational projects, much as U.S. dollar diplomacy did to the Latin American customs unions of the 1960s. Whether or not the 30 % duty materialises, the mere threat is nudging firms to reroute supply chains and could normalise double-digit transatlantic tariffs for the first time since the Kennedy Round (1964-67). On a century horizon, this moment may mark a pivot away from the seven-decade experiment in deep U.S.–EU economic integration toward a more fragmented, bloc-based system reminiscent of the inter-war era—unless a new framework resurrects shared rules.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **U.S. mainstream fact-checking press (e.g., CBS News)**: Trump’s claim that Europe “doesn’t buy” U.S. cars or farm goods is wrong; trade data show the EU is still a major market, so new tariffs rest on a faulty premise and would raise prices for consumers. By centering on the president’s factual misstatements, coverage can underplay the EU’s own higher agricultural tariffs and broader trade imbalance, reinforcing a narrative that primarily faults Trump rather than structural frictions.

- **European left-leaning commentary outlets (e.g., The Guardian)**: Brussels must stop ‘chickening out’ and retaliate forcefully against Trump’s 30 % tariff threat, because yielding would embolden U.S. bullying and fuel Europe’s far-right nationalism. The argument casts the dispute as a moral struggle against nationalism, which may exaggerate the political stakes and downplay the immediate economic pain a tariff war would inflict on EU workers and consumers.

- **Global financial newswires (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg/Politico)**: The EU has drafted a €72 billion hit-list of U.S. goods—from Boeing jets to bourbon—while dispatching its trade chief to Washington in hopes of a negotiated deal before the Aug 1 deadline, signalling a pragmatic desire to avert a damaging trade war. Market-oriented framing tends to treat tariffs as bargaining chips and foreground corporate impacts, potentially glossing over broader societal or environmental issues and giving officials’ talking points an uncritical platform.
