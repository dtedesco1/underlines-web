# Moscow Moves to Blacklist WhatsApp and Shift Users to State-Run “MAX” Messenger

On 18 July 2025 two senior Duma members warned that WhatsApp will almost certainly be added to a new blacklist of “unfriendly” foreign software, clearing the way for a Kremlin-backed replacement app.

#### Focusing Facts

- Putin’s 16 July directive orders new restrictions on foreign communication services by 1 September 2025.

- Mediascope estimates 97.4 million Russians—about 68 % of the population—use WhatsApp daily.

- VK’s domestic alternative “MAX” launched in 2025 and is to be pre-installed on Russian devices from September 2025.

#### Context

Russia’s drive echoes earlier information controls—from Nicholas II’s 1905 Telegraph censorship to the 2012–2017 attempts to throttle Twitter and Telegram, and mirrors China’s 2000-era Great Firewall that fostered WeChat.  The long arc is the fracturing of a once-global Internet into competing sovereign networks (“splinternet”), reinforced by sanctions and the Ukraine war.  While a ban may look tactical today, it signals a structural pivot: the state wants citizens’ everyday chats, IDs and payments inside a domestically auditable stack, tightening surveillance but also nurturing a protected tech market.  A century from now, historians may read 2025 as the moment Russia definitively traded open connectivity for managed digital autarky—accelerating the balkanisation of cyberspace much like the post-World-War-I breakup of telegraph monopolies fragmented global communications.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Russian state-owned media (e.g., TASS, RT)**: Portray a looming WhatsApp ban as a justified move to safeguard national security and boost the Kremlin-endorsed MAX messenger. Because these outlets are state-aligned, they mirror government talking points and gloss over the civil-liberty costs or surveillance fears implicit in forcing users onto a state platform. ([TASS](https://tass.com/economy/1991309), [RT](https://www.rt.com/russia/621660-whatsapp-legal-restrictions-russia/))

- **Exiled independent Russian press (e.g., Meduza)**: Argues the ban is chiefly a political tool to stifle public dissent and tighten the security services’ grip on information flows. Leaning toward an opposition readership and citing unnamed insiders, it may accentuate repression narratives and speculate about Kremlin motives beyond what is on record.

- **International mainstream business/tech outlets (e.g., Reuters, Economic Times)**: Report that Moscow is preparing to blacklist WhatsApp as part of a broader digital-sovereignty agenda that promotes the home-grown MAX app and penalises foreign tech firms. Event-focused wire reporting tends to rely on official statements and may understate the broader censorship context while framing the story primarily as a market or policy development.
