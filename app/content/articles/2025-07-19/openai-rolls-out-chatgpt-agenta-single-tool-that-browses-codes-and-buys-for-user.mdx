# OpenAI Rolls Out ChatGPT ‘Agent’—a Single Tool That Browses, Codes and Buys for Users

On 17 July 2025 OpenAI switched on “ChatGPT Agent,” giving paid ChatGPT tiers an autonomous mode that can run a sandboxed virtual computer to carry out multi-step online tasks without human clicks.

#### Focusing Facts

- Pro subscribers ($200/month) received access immediately with a quota of 400 agent prompts per month; Plus and Team users get 40 prompts, while Enterprise/Education rollout is slated before end-July.

- The agent merges two earlier 2025 pilots—Operator (web interaction) and Deep Research (long-form web search)—and can now log into services like Gmail or Google Drive, generate PowerPoints, and place online orders after user confirmation.

- Launch is currently geo-limited: the feature is not yet available in the European Economic Area or Switzerland.

#### Context

Software history shows step-changes when passive tools become active agents: VisiCalc (1979) turned calculators into business partners; Microsoft’s Clippy (1997) tried but failed to automate desktop chores; Amazon’s 1-Click (1999) shrank shopping to a tap. OpenAI’s agent embodies the next oscillation—from user-driven interfaces to delegation of intent, echoing decades-long automation trends from factory robots (1960s) to airline autopilots (1930s→present). If agentic AI proves reliable, it could compress knowledge work much as industrial robots compressed manufacturing labour, tilting economic value toward those who own the agents and the data pipes they ride. Yet early glitches, quota limits and regional exclusions highlight that we are at the ‘Model-T’ stage: impressive but fragile. Whether 2125 historians see this as the spreadsheet moment for cognitive labour or as another Clippy-style cul-de-sac will hinge on trust, governance and who captures the productivity surplus.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business and investor-focused media (e.g., Bloomberg Business, Forbes, Investing.com, Inc., Australian Financial Review)**: Present ChatGPT Agent as a breakthrough commercial product that will streamline work, usher in the age of autonomous AI assistants and open lucrative new revenue streams for OpenAI. Stories compete for finance-minded readers and investor attention, so they accentuate growth potential and market leadership while skimming over technical risks or past reliability hiccups called out elsewhere. ([Bloomberg Business](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-17/chatgpt-will-soon-shop-online-make-powerpoints-on-your-behalf), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2025/07/17/openai-launching-chatgpt-agent-heres-what-to-know/))

- **Technical press sceptical of AI hype (e.g., Ars Technica, Wired)**: Acknowledge the new capabilities but stress that ChatGPT Agent still stumbles on complex tasks, faces prompt-injection dangers and remains far from true problem-solving intelligence. These outlets build credibility by stress-testing big tech claims, so they foreground limitations and security caveats that keep their expert audiences engaged, sometimes making the tool seem weaker than everyday users may experience. ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/chatgpts-new-ai-agent-can-browse-the-web-and-create-powerpoint-slideshows/), [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-chatgpt-agent-launch/))

- **Mainstream general-interest news highlighting caution (e.g., NBC News, News18)**: Frame the launch as an exciting consumer-facing convenience but emphasize that the system is experimental, has recently suffered outages and shouldn’t yet be trusted for high-stakes tasks. A need to protect broad audiences and draw clicks leads to spotlighting warnings and service disruptions, which can overplay worries relative to the product’s typical performance.
