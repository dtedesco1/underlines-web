# EU Approves 18th Russia Sanctions, Cuts Oil Price Cap to $47.6

On 18 July 2025 every EU member finally backed an 18th sanctions package that immediately lowers the G7 price ceiling on Russian crude to 15 % below market, starting at roughly $47.6 per barrel and paired with new energy-sector and shipping curbs.

#### Focusing Facts

- Slovakia ended its weeks-long veto after securing gas-price assurances, clearing the package for unanimous adoption on 18 July 2025.

- The package introduces a floating crude cap—initially $47.6—plus a blacklist of 105 ‘shadow-fleet’ tankers, enforceable only by EU/UK insurers and shippers because the United States declined to join.

- Brussels also sanctioned Rosneft’s Vadinar refinery in India and two unnamed Chinese banks, the first time EU measures reach assets located in those countries.

#### Context

Economic warfare against a major power is hardly new: the League of Nations’ 1935 oil embargo on Mussolini’s Italy and the 1806 Continental System both sought to grind down an aggressor through trade constraints yet faltered when key players kept buying.  The EU’s latest move fits a decades-long trend of weaponising interdependence—finance, shipping insurance, SWIFT access—to pursue geopolitical aims while trying to avoid outright supply shocks.  By tightening the cap without U.S. backing, Brussels is testing how much leverage the euro-based logistics and insurance ecosystem has versus the dollar-centred one, and whether a fragmented West can still police global commodity flows.  Over a 100-year horizon the episode may matter less for its immediate hit to Kremlin revenues than for accelerating the balkanisation of energy markets and encouraging alternative payment networks; if the cap proves porous, it could join past sanctions regimes as a cautionary tale of limited coercive power in an already multipolar trading system.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European mainstream outlets (e.g., France 24, Le Monde)**: Describe the 18th EU sanctions package as an “unprecedented” show of unity that will sap Russia’s war chest and force Vladimir Putin toward a cease-fire. By echoing EU officials’ talking points they play up European resolve and may gloss over enforcement limits or member-state bargaining revealed only in passing. ([France 24](https://www.france24.com/en/business/20250718-eu-agrees-unprecedented-round-sanctions-targeting-russia-oil-exports), [Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/07/18/eu-agrees-18th-round-of-russia-sanctions-over-ukraine-war_6743483_4.html))

- **Financial and market-focused media (e.g., CNBC, Reuters)**: Note the agreement but stress that traders doubt the lower price cap’s real bite, citing U.S. reluctance and past ineffectiveness of the G7 cap. Prioritising market mechanics and investor concerns can understate the geopolitical or moral drivers behind the sanctions and frame them mainly through efficacy metrics. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/eu-lowers-price-cap-for-russian-crude-under-new-sanctions-package.html), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-approves-new-russia-sanctions-with-lower-oil-price-cap-2025-07-18/))

- **Russian state-owned media (TASS)**: Highlights Slovakia’s resistance and lingering talks to suggest the EU still struggles to finalise the package while warning Moscow of ‘serious economic consequences.’ Framing EU divisions serves to downplay Western cohesion and reassure domestic audiences, consistent with Kremlin messaging that sanctions momentum is faltering.
