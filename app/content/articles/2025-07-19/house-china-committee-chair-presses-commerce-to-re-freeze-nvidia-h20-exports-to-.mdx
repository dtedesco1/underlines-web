# House China Committee Chair Presses Commerce to Re-freeze Nvidia H20 Exports to China

On 18 Jul 2025 Rep. John Moolenaar formally asked Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to reverse this week’s green-light for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips to China, framing the sale as a national-security threat and rattling Nvidia’s share price.

#### Focusing Facts

- Moolenaar’s letter dated 18 Jul 2025 requests a Commerce Department briefing by 8 Aug 2025 on licensing volumes for H20 shipments.

- The H20 had been barred under an April 2025 export control but was cleared for re-export earlier the same week, marking a policy U-turn.

- Nvidia confirmed it received U.S. assurances of resumed H20 sales but neither the company nor Commerce publicly commented after the letter, sending NVDA shares briefly into negative territory on 18 Jul.

#### Context

Washington has cycled through export clamp-downs and selective relaxations many times—CoCom’s 1981 denial of DEC VAX computers to the Soviet bloc and the 1999 loosening of high-speed computer exports are only two precedents—each reflecting the tension between commercial gain and strategic fear.  Today’s dispute sits at the intersection of a 15-year trend toward U.S.–China tech decoupling and a century-long pattern in which the dominant power tries to throttle rival access to general-purpose technologies (oil to Japan in 1941, uranium centrifuges to Iran in the 2000s, now AI accelerators).  Whether the H20 stays or goes will barely dent near-term Chinese AI progress—Beijing can still source chips via gray markets—but the episode matters because it signals how export controls are becoming permanent instruments of industrial policy, not temporary levers.  Over a 100-year horizon, the contest is less about one GPU model and more about whether tightly controlled U.S. tech ecosystems can remain globally indispensable as alternatives mature elsewhere, echoing the gradual erosion of post-war U.S. monopoly on advanced computing.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US national security–focused Republican lawmakers (e.g., House Select Committee on China)**: They warn that restarting Nvidia’s H20 chip exports will strengthen Beijing’s military AI, aid censorship and erode the U.S. tech edge, so the Commerce Department should keep the ban in place. These lawmakers benefit politically from portraying any tech transfer to China as an existential threat, which can amplify worst-case scenarios and overlook commercial realities.

- **U.S. trade and economic officials backing limited sales (Commerce Department, Treasury negotiators)**: Officials say narrowly licensed H20 shipments can keep Chinese firms reliant on the American hardware–software stack and serve as leverage for concessions such as rare-earth access. Their argument minimizes security risks and aligns with corporate lobbying by Nvidia, reflecting an incentive to preserve profits and broader trade deals.

- **Chinese government officials (China’s Commerce Ministry)**: Beijing depicts the U.S. export curbs as a “zero-sum mindset” and urges Washington to scrap the “unjustified” restrictions on Nvidia’s chips. Framing the dispute as free-trade obstruction sidesteps concerns over military use, aiming to secure advanced U.S. technology to accelerate China’s own AI ambitions.
