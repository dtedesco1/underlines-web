# EU Enacts 16th Sanctions Package Against Russia, Asserting Independent Policy Amid US Divergence

On February 18-19, 2025, EU diplomats approved their 16th round of sanctions targeting Russia’s key economic sectors, signaling a clear move to independently counter Moscow despite conflicting US signals.

#### Focusing Facts

- The package sanctions 13 banks, 73 shadow fleet tankers, and phases in a ban on certain Russian aluminium imports.

- Hungary secured exemptions for its energy imports and critical infrastructure, including the Druzhba pipeline and Budapest metro maintenance.

- The measures coincide with the third anniversary of Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine.

#### Context

This pivot to an autonomous sanctions policy recalls historical moments when Europe decided to set its own strategic course. Much like the independent European reactions following the Prague Spring crackdown in 1968—which underscored divergent approaches between European states and external powers—the current sanctions package reflects a longer-term trend in which the EU prioritizes its own security and economic interests over external pressures. Over a century, such decisions have shaped the region’s resilience and its ability to negotiate in a multilateral world, highlighting an ongoing shift towards a more self-reliant European order.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Pro-EU Sanctions Advocates**: They assert that the European Union is decisively forging its own independent path in imposing stringent sanctions on Russia to pressure Moscow amid its war in Ukraine. This narrative tends to amplify official EU positions and downplay internal conflicts or economic side effects, aligning closely with mainstream Western policy perspectives.

- **Hungarian Government Supporters**: They emphasize that the current EU sanctions package includes significant concessions for Hungary—protecting its energy security and economic interests—while questioning the sanctions' overall effectiveness. This perspective is shaped by national interests and a reluctance to fully commit to punitive measures, reflecting political and economic incentives to maintain links with Russia.

- **Alternative Online Commentators**: They argue that the sanctions appear to be driven more by political signaling, particularly towards the US, rather than constituting effective measures against Russia. This view is expressed in a highly opinionated and informal style, merging political commentary with provocative rhetoric, and may lack balanced analysis.
