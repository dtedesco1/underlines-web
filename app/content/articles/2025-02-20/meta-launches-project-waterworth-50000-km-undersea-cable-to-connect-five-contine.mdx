# Meta Launches 'Project Waterworth': 50,000 km Undersea Cable to Connect Five Continents

On February 2025, Meta announced Project Waterworth—a multi-billion-dollar, multi-year initiative to lay a 50,000 km (31,000 mile) undersea cable system connecting the US, India, South Africa, Brazil, and other regions to bolster high-capacity, AI-driven infrastructure.

#### Focusing Facts

- The cable will use a 24 fiber-pair system to significantly increase data capacity over existing routes.

- It is engineered to be deployed up to 7,000 meters deep with enhanced burial techniques to mitigate risks from ship anchors and natural hazards.

- Meta’s investment is estimated at a multi-billion-dollar scale, possibly exceeding $10 billion, with the project expected to complete by the end of the decade.

#### Context

Project Waterworth echoes historical technological leaps such as the 1858 transatlantic telegraph cable which revolutionized communication and the 1988 deployment of the first fiber-optic cables that reshaped global data flows. This initiative not only marks a shift from telecom-run infrastructure to tech giant-driven connectivity—reflecting trends seen with Google and Amazon’s similar ventures—but also raises enduring concerns about market concentration and geopolitical vulnerabilities. Over the next century, as digital inclusion and AI capabilities increasingly depend on resilient high-speed networks, the strategic control and security of such infrastructure will be pivotal in shaping global economic and political landscapes.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream tech media**: This group praises Project Waterworth as a landmark digital infrastructure initiative that will enhance global connectivity, drive AI innovation, and boost economic and technological development. They often focus on the project’s transformative potential while downplaying risks related to overconcentration of tech power and geopolitical vulnerabilities.

- **Conservative/critical media**: This group frames the project as an example of Meta's overreach, emphasizing concerns over increased concentration of digital power and vulnerabilities in global infrastructure amid geopolitical tensions. They may be inclined to stress potential risks and negative implications to critique big tech dominance, sometimes underplaying the benefits of enhanced connectivity.
