# Broadcom and TSMC Weigh Intel Breakup Amid Mounting Financial Woes

On February 18, 2025, reports surfaced that Broadcom and TSMC are in early, informal talks to split Intel into a chip design unit and a manufacturing division to unlock shareholder value amid mounting losses.

#### Focusing Facts

- Broardcom is reportedly considering a bid for Intel’s chip design and marketing business, while TSMC is eyeing control over Intel’s US fabs, as per multiple sources on February 18, 2025.

- Intel’s foundry division posted a $13 billion operating loss on $17.5 billion revenue in 2024, with the company’s stock down 60% the previous year before a recent surge.

- Reports note that the Trump administration has backed potential TSMC deals to secure US chip manufacturing, adding a political dimension to the breakup talks.

#### Context

This emerging breakup echoes historical restructurings like AT&T's divestiture in 1984, marking a shift in how legacy giants adapt to modern market and geopolitical pressures. Over decades, financial underperformance amid rapid technological change has forced companies to consider radical restructuring to remain competitive. The current discussions, involving foreign and domestic political interests along with regulatory hurdles, reflect long-term trends in global supply chains and the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing. Even if the immediate market reaction is bullish, the structural repercussions on national industry autonomy and global manufacturing paradigms will only be measurable over the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Market Analysts and Investment-Focused Media**: They argue that splitting Intel could unlock significant shareholder value by streamlining operations and addressing long-standing manufacturing inefficiencies. Their focus on financial metrics and activist hedge fund opportunities might downplay the operational risks and broader geopolitical implications. ([Yahoo!

- **Government and Geopolitical-Focused Media**: They emphasize the role of U.S. national security and economic interests, highlighting how political pressure—especially from the Trump administration—could drive Intel’s manufacturing to be managed by TSMC. This perspective may emphasize political and regulatory agendas while underplaying corporate financial motives and market dynamics.
