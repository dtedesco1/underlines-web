# UK Inflation Jumps to 3% in January Amid Global Price Pressures

In January 2025, the UK saw inflation unexpectedly rise to 3% due to surging private school fees and stagnant airfare drops, while inflation concerns globally are exacerbated by rising US core inflation and tariff policies.

#### Focusing Facts

- UK inflation increased from 2.5% in December to 3% in January 2025, driven by a 13% hike in private school fees following VAT changes.

- US core CPI jumped to an annualised rate of 5.5% in January, with consumer inflation expectations rising by 1.7 percentage points amid tariff threats.

- Canada recorded a modest 1.9% inflation rate and Nigeria's rebase did not signify real price drops despite high living costs.

#### Context

The January 2025 inflation spike in the UK, reminiscent of the volatile period when inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022—the highest in over 40 years—signals a broader trend of price instability. This scenario echoes episodes such as the early 1980s when aggressive policy adjustments were needed to tame price surges. In the US, mounting core inflation and tariff-induced uncertainties recall the post-pandemic inflationary pressures seen around 2021-2022, highlighting how policy moves like tariffs can exacerbate underlying trends. Though each country faces unique catalysts—from VAT changes in the UK to tariff policies in the US and recalculated measures in Nigeria—the convergence of these developments underscores long-term challenges to monetary stability and consumer purchasing power that could ripple through economies for decades to come.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **UK Mainstream Media**: These articles report on the inflation data and policy responses in the UK with a focus on factual, real-time economic statistics and government measures such as tax changes and interest rate adjustments. While they aim to inform with hard data, the selection and framing of figures might underemphasize deeper structural or consumer hardship issues.

- **US Political Economic Analysts**: These pieces, from sources like The Economist and The Motley Fool, analyze inflation by linking rising prices to political decisions, including tariff policies and partisan conflicts that influence consumer expectations and market sentiments. Their commentary often interweaves political critique with economic analysis, potentially overstating partisan influences and speculative impacts of policy moves.

- **Emerging Market Skeptics**: This perspective challenges official inflation readings by highlighting that revisions in measurement, as seen in Nigeria’s figures, do not reflect real improvements in consumers’ cost of living. Such reporting may be driven by a need to underscore persistent economic hardships, possibly amplifying the critique of official data without fully considering methodological changes.
