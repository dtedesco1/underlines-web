# Trump Sets Stage for 25% Tariffs on Autos, Pharma, and Semiconductors

On February 18-19, 2025, President Trump signaled his intent to impose tariffs starting at 25% on vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductor imports, with details to be finalized by April 2.

#### Focusing Facts

- Tariffs of approximately 25% are expected to launch on auto, drug, and semiconductor imports starting as early as April 2, with potential increases over the year.

- These measures add to existing tariffs, such as 25% on steel and aluminum and a 10% levy on Chinese imports, as part of a broader reciprocal tariff strategy.

- Trump has indicated reciprocal tariffs could reach up to 100% for BRICS countries, highlighting an escalation in his trade war approach.

#### Context

This move marks a significant escalation in a tariff strategy reminiscent of past trade confrontations. Much like the protectionist moves during the Smoot-Hawley era in the 1930s—which are widely studied for their long-term disruptive effects on global commerce—Trump's recent tariff announcements reflect a century-long tension between national economic protection and global trade liberalization. Moreover, echoes of similar strategies during his first term in 2018 and 2019 resurface, where auto imports were scrutinized for undermining domestic manufacturing. In the long run, these actions could reshape trade relationships and supply chains, impacting global economic patterns over decades, even if the immediate effects remain uncertain amid ongoing negotiations and reciprocal tariffs.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US Trade Policy Advocates**: They interpret Trump's proposed tariffs as a strategic move to protect American industries and rebalance global trade by countering what they see as unfair trade practices. This perspective often downplays short-term economic disruptions and emphasizes long-term nationalistic benefits, potentially overlooking immediate costs and global repercussions.

- **International Economic Impact Critics**: They view the tariffs as a catalyst for a broader trade war that could increase costs for consumers and destabilize international supply chains. This approach may overemphasize the negative global economic fallout to undermine aggressive trade policies, focusing on worst-case scenarios rather than balanced outcomes.
