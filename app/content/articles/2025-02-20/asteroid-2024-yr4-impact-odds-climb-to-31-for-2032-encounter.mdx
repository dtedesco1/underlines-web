# Asteroid 2024 YR4 Impact Odds Climb to 3.1% for 2032 Encounter

After successive orbital refinements since its December 2024 discovery, NASA and partners now estimate a 3.1% chance of asteroid 2024 YR4 striking Earth on December 22, 2032.

#### Focusing Facts

- NASA's estimates rose from a 1-in-83 chance to a current 1-in-38 probability.

- The asteroid, estimated at 40–90 meters in width, could unleash 7.7–8 megatons of TNT energy on impact.

- It is classified as a Level 3 threat on the Torino Scale, warranting attention for localized catastrophic damage.

#### Context

Historically, near-Earth threats such as asteroid Apophis in 2004—which briefly held a 2.7% impact chance—were later downgraded as more data were collected, much like the case with 2024 YR4. The revised odds echo past recalculations seen after events like the 1908 Tunguska airburst, which, despite its devastating localized effects, left minimal global consequences. This event signals improvements in early detection and tracking technologies, including the use of advanced space telescopes like the James Webb, and underscores a long-term trend towards more precise planetary defense strategies. While a 3.1% chance remains unlikely in a century-long view, its stepwise increase exemplifies the evolving and measured refinement of risk assessment that will shape future space policy and preparedness over the coming 100 years.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Science-based news outlets**: They present the growing probability of 2024 YR4’s Earth encounter in detailed, technical terms, emphasizing ongoing data collection and uncertainty in risk projections. Their focus on scientific nuance may understate the potential dramatization by not stressing sensational red-alert headlines, relying heavily on NASA’s iterative updates.

- **Sensationalist media**: They frame the asteroid as a ‘city killer’ and stress the rising odds with dramatic language to capture immediate public attention. This approach can exaggerate risk implications and play up alarmist narratives to drive viewership, even though experts often point to eventual probability reductions.

- **Local and regional outlets**: They highlight the practical implications by discussing specific risk corridors, potential local impacts, and offering reassurances based on NASA’s updates. Such reporting may overemphasize localized risk details to engage local audiences, possibly inflating concerns despite overall low global risk.
