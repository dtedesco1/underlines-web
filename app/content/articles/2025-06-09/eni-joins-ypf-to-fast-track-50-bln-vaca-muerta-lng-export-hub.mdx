# Eni Joins YPF to Fast-Track $50 Bln Vaca Muerta LNG Export Hub

On 6 June 2025 Eni formally agreed to co-develop Argentina’s first large-scale LNG chain, a prerequisite to a 12 Mtpa Phase-1 final investment decision and eventual 30 Mtpa exports by 2030.

#### Focusing Facts

- Signing took place in Rome in the presence of President Javier Milei and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on 6 June 2025.

- Phase-1 foresees 12 Mtpa of LNG via floating units; total planned exports scale to 30 Mtpa by 2030, fed by the Vaca Muerta shale play.

- Project budget is estimated near $50 billion, including a 580 km pipeline to a liquefaction site at Sierra Grande, Río Negro.

#### Context

Resource frontiers repeatedly leap when a technological player marries a stranded basin: Qatar’s 1992 Ras Laffan FID transformed the North Field into today’s 110 Mtpa LNG giant, while Australia’s Curtis Island build-out (2010-16) used US-born shale drilling to flip export geography. 2025’s Eni-YPF pact echoes those pivots—linking Argentina’s Vaca Muerta (the world’s #2 shale gas reserve) to floating LNG technology honed in Mozambique and Congo. It signals three structural trends: 1) post-Ukraine scramble for non-Russian gas keeps LNG demand buoyant; 2) emerging producers leverage FLNG to bypass decade-long onshore builds; 3) southern-cone governments bet hydrocarbons can bankroll an eventual energy transition. Over a 100-year arc, this move could either entrench Argentina as a new LNG pillar—diversifying global supply like Qatar did—or strand capital if decarbonisation and methane scrutiny accelerate. The moment matters because it tests whether late-comer shale nations can still monetize gas before carbon budgets close.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Corporate press release (Eni)**: Presents the agreement as a strategic milestone that advances Argentina LNG while fitting neatly into Eni’s broader energy-transition roadmap toward carbon neutrality by 2050. As a self-authored release it promotes the deal’s upside, glossing over financial or environmental risks to reassure investors and policymakers.

- **International wire services (Reuters and reprints)**: Report the signing as a factual business development, noting capacity targets, meeting details and Eni’s technical role without overt commentary. Depend heavily on company statements so the coverage is concise and conflict-averse, offering limited scrutiny of environmental or market uncertainties.

- **Energy industry trade outlets (Rigzone, Offshore Technology, Trend)**: Frame the project as a major boost for global LNG supply and a showcase of floating LNG technology, stressing its multibillion-dollar scale and export potential. Industry-centric angle champions fossil-fuel expansion and technical feats, downplaying climate implications while amplifying projected economic benefits.
