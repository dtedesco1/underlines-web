# 14–15 Aug 2025 Inflation Releases Show U.S. PPI Spike Amid Indian Deflation and Easing Nigerian CPI

Within 24 hours, July price data revealed a 0.9 % jump in U.S. producer prices—while India’s wholesale index slipped further into negative territory and Nigeria’s consumer inflation dipped, highlighting sharply diverging price pressures just ahead of key central-bank rate decisions.

#### Focusing Facts

- U.S. Producer Price Index rose 0.9 % in July 2025, lifting the year-on-year rate to 3.3 %, the steepest monthly gain since 2022.

- India’s Wholesale Price Index registered –0.58 % year-on-year in July 2025, its lowest reading since June 2017 and second straight month in deflation.

- Nigeria’s headline CPI eased to 21.88 % in July 2025 from 22.22 % in June, marking the fourth consecutive monthly decline.

#### Context

The simultaneous publication of inflation data from three very different economies echoes June 1974, when U.S. wholesale prices were soaring even as Japan and West Germany flirted with disinflation—signaling that global price cycles can decouple under trade and monetary frictions.  Today’s numbers spotlight two structural forces moving in opposite directions: de-globalization and tariff walls that push U.S. input costs up, and improving harvests plus statistical base effects that are cooling prices in emerging markets.  If these divergent trends persist, policy paths will widen—much as they did after the 1982 Volcker shock, when the Fed tightened while parts of the Global South cut rates to fight recession.  Over a 100-year horizon, the episode matters because it tests the post-1990 assumption of synchronized inflation cycles born of integrated supply chains; a lasting decoupling would hand individual central banks more autonomy but could also fragment capital flows and complicate any future attempt at coordinated crisis response.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Financial/business press (e.g., MarketWatch reports carried by Morningstar)**: July’s sharp PPI jump is an early warning that Trump-era tariffs are beginning to stoke broader inflation, potentially complicating the Fed’s plan to cut rates. By tying the data to tariffs the coverage creates a market-moving narrative and implicitly critiques protectionist policy, even though the same articles note the increase might be temporary and only partly tariff-linked. ([Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250814131/wholesale-prices-post-biggest-surge-in-three-years-ppi-shows-sign-of-tariff-related-inflation), [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250814139/wholesale-prices-post-biggest-surge-in-three-years-ppi-shows-in-sign-of-tariff-related-inflation))

- **Libertarian/free-market commentary (e.g., TalkMarkets)**: The CPI uptick is not tariff-driven at all; it is the predictable result of faster money-supply growth and loose Fed policy, so blaming Trump’s trade measures is partisan grandstanding. Ideological commitment to monetary explanations and free-trade orthodoxy leads this camp to minimise any tariff effect and shift responsibility squarely onto the central bank, matching its longstanding critique of government intervention.
