# SpaceX Debuts Supersized 3-Fin Super Heavy Design After FAA Clears Flight 10

SpaceX scrapped the Super Heavy’s fourth grid fin, unveiling three fins 50 % larger and lower-mounted just hours after the FAA closed the Flight-9 mishap probe and authorised the next launch window opening 24 Aug 2025.

#### Focusing Facts

- FAA formally closed the Starship Flight-9 investigation on 15 Aug 2025, green-lighting Flight 10 no earlier than 24 Aug at 23:30 UTC.

- Booster 16 now sports three grid fins with 50 % more surface area, relocated below mid-tank with a new catch point to align with the launch-tower arms.

- Flight 10 plans to deploy eight Starlink mass simulators and target controlled splashdowns—Gulf of Mexico for the booster, Indian Ocean for Ship 37.

#### Context

Rocket history is littered with hardware pivots after flight losses—think NASA’s switch to the Block II Saturn V after the pogo-oscillation scare in 1968, or the Soviets’ hurried redesigns of the N1 in 1971. SpaceX’s fin overhaul fits that lineage: rapid, iterative fixes following consecutive 2025 failures. It also underscores two macro trends: private firms, not states, now drive launch-vehicle evolution, and reusability—not throwaway expendables—is the industry’s organizing principle. Whether the larger, fewer fins succeed matters far beyond one test: reliable tower catches would slash turnaround times and launch costs, a prerequisite for high-cadence Moon logistics under Artemis III (target 2027) and any Mars flotilla later in the century. If the redesign works, 2025 could be remembered as the year Starship transitioned from exploding prototype to industrial transport; if it doesn’t, history may file it alongside the N1 as another cautionary tale of overreach.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Tech-enthusiast outlets (Digital Trends, Wccftech, Next Big Future, Gadget Review)**: Portray the supersized grid-fin redesign as a game-changing upgrade that will sharpen landings and keep Starship on pace for NASA’s Artemis goals and Musk’s Mars vision. Coverage hews closely to SpaceX social-media posts, amplifying corporate optimism while skimming over the string of flight failures and schedule slips highlighted elsewhere.

- **Science & mainstream news publications (Ars Technica, The Independent, Space.com)**: Frame the redesign against a backdrop of four straight Starship setbacks and FAA probes, warning that unresolved leaks and explosions could jeopardize future milestones and NASA timelines. Emphasis on mishaps and delays builds a cautionary, sometimes dramatic narrative that may underplay the incremental engineering wins celebrated by enthusiast media.

- **Local South Texas outlets and Starbase livestream community (Valley Central / LabPadre)**: Offer ground-level updates on pad construction, hardware moves, and booster maintenance, depicting steady on-site progress toward Flight 10. Relying on SpaceX activity for regional economic stories and livestream traffic, they seldom scrutinize safety, environmental, or scheduling controversies that wider media raise.
