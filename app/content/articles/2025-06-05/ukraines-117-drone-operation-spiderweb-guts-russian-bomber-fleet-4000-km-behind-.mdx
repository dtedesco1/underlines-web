# Ukraine’s 117-Drone ‘Operation Spiderweb’ Guts Russian Bomber Fleet 4,000 km Behind the Front

On 1 June 2025, Ukraine remotely activated 117 drones pre-positioned inside Russia, striking four air bases up to 4,300 km from the front and destroying roughly a dozen strategic bombers, a first-ever deep penetration that exposes Russia’s rear to cheap unmanned attack.

#### Focusing Facts

- Two U.S. officials told Reuters the raid destroyed ~10 and damaged up to 20 Russian warplanes, without prior notice to Washington.

- NATO’s internal tally lists 15 Tu-95s, 20 Tu-22s and one A-50 hit—amounting to 34 % of Russia’s cruise-missile carrier fleet.

- U.S. defense analysts say $600 drones eliminated bombers that each cost roughly $100 million.

#### Context

States have misjudged sanctuary before: the April 1942 Doolittle Raid showed Tokyo was reachable, and Britain’s 1917 Gotha raids convinced London to disperse its air defense—both far-from-decisive yet psychologically pivotal.  Operation Spiderweb fits a century-long trend in which cheaper, unmanned or improvised weapons erode the strategic depth of large territories, much like Hezbollah’s $20,000 drones reaching Israeli gas rigs in 2021.  Whether 10 or 40 bombers were lost is less important than forcing Moscow to dilute air defenses across eleven time zones and face the reality that Soviet-era aircraft no longer in production are attriting faster than they can be replaced.  On a 100-year horizon, the raid is another data point showing the offense-defense cost curve tilting toward the offense; empires protected by distance—be it Imperial Japan, continental U.S., or today’s Russia—can no longer assume security from geography alone.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (The New York Times, Washington Post, Financial Times)**: They frame Ukraine’s deep-strike drone operation as a bold, game-changing success that degrades Russia’s strategic air power and signals Kyiv can reshape the war’s dynamics. Coverage spotlights Ukrainian ingenuity and stresses Russian weakness, echoing Western official assessments while glossing over lingering uncertainty about actual damage totals.

- **International wire service reporters (Reuters)**: Reports describe the raid as significant yet stress that open-source imagery and U.S. intelligence suggest fewer aircraft were destroyed than Kyiv claims, adding possible repercussions for peace talks. By privileging U.S. officials and verifiable imagery, the pieces downplay higher Ukrainian figures and may understate Kyiv’s narrative to preserve a reputation for measured objectivity.

- **Ukrainian national media quoting NATO officials (Українська правда)**: They hail the strike as the most successful operation of the war, asserting that around 40 Russian aircraft were damaged and over a third of missile-carrier bombers destroyed, critically denting Moscow’s capabilities. Reliant on anonymous NATO and Ukrainian security sources, the coverage amplifies Kyiv’s triumphalist messaging to boost morale and international support, with little independent verification of the high damage estimates.
