# US Axes ‘Safety’ From Federal AI Institute Amid Rapid Commercial Pivot

On 5 June 2025 the Trump administration renamed the Biden-era U.S. AI Safety Institute to the Center for AI Standards and Innovation, signaling a deregulatory stance just as industry players from newsrooms to consultancies unveiled aggressive new AI spending and subscription models.

#### Focusing Facts

- Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced the rebrand on 5 June 2025, dropping the word “Safety” and refocusing the body on “innovation” and foreign-origin threat monitoring.

- The change coincided with a 23-country Ipsos Mori poll showing 66 % of Britons and 25 % of adults worldwide unsure what AI even is, underscoring a trust gap in Anglophone nations.

- On the same day, consulting giant Globant introduced monthly ‘AI Pods’ subscriptions—token-metered virtual workforces—abandoning traditional hours-based billing.

#### Context

Washington’s pivot echoes 1980’s deregulation of telecoms and the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall: both ceded guardrails to unleash private capital, with mixed long-run results.  The withdrawal of “safety” language marks a swing in the century-long cycle between innovation zeal and precaution (compare the Atomic Energy Act 1946 versus Eisenhower’s 1953 ‘Atoms for Peace’ push).  Structurally, it spotlights a widening trans-Atlantic split: the EU’s June 2024 AI Act tightened risk tiers while the U.S. now courts unfettered growth, reviving a Reagan-era faith that market speed beats regulation.  Whether this moment looms large in 2125 will hinge on path-dependence: early standards bodies often ossify into global norm-setters (see ICAO 1944), so gutting “safety” today could hard-wire profit-first incentives into AI’s formative decades—or prove a footnote if future crises force a pendulum swing back toward oversight.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (The Guardian, Education Week)**: They argue that the public is increasingly nervous about AI and that strong government regulation and clear guidance are essential to protect society. By foregrounding fear and regulation, they risk overstating worst-case scenarios and underplaying AI’s potential economic upside, which can attract readers wary of big tech.

- **Business and trade publications focused on industry adoption (Digiday, Business Insider, Forbes)**: They portray AI as an indispensable productivity tool that companies are racing to integrate, highlighting rising budgets, new subscription models and operational wins. Their boosterish tone may gloss over ethical risks and job losses because their audiences and advertisers benefit from portraying AI as an inevitable profit driver.

- **Pro-deregulation U.S. conservative officials and sympathetic coverage (Yahoo on Trump administration)**: They frame safety-focused oversight as a drag on competitiveness and celebrate the Trump administration’s shift toward a 'pro-innovation' AI policy that strips out regulatory language. This market-first framing may downplay security and consumer harms to advance a political narrative that government regulation stifles business.
