# Trump Doubles Section 232 Tariffs to 50 % on Imported Steel & Aluminum

At 12:01 a.m. ET on 4 June 2025, U.S. duties on foreign steel and aluminum jumped from 25 % to 50 % via a Trump executive order, with only the U.K. temporarily exempt.

#### Focusing Facts

- Canada—America’s top metals supplier—had already seen steel shipments to the U.S. fall 30 % after March’s 25 % tariff and now faces the full 50 % rate.

- The hike was imposed under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, sidestepping the 1977 emergency powers now mired in court challenges.

- Britain’s tariff stays at 25 % until 9 July 2025 under a provisional trade deal; all other partners, including Mexico and South Korea, pay 50 %.

#### Context

Tariff walls this steep recall the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act—whose average duties spiked to 45 % and deepened the Great Depression—and Richard Nixon’s short-lived 10 % import surcharge in 1971. Like those episodes, today’s move reflects a recurring U.S. cycle: domestic political pressure meets fears of foreign industrial overcapacity, producing protectionist bursts that often unwind later. Structurally, the order signals Washington’s shift from multilateral WTO rules toward unilateral ‘national-security’ industrial policy, mirroring China’s own capacity-driven state aid since the 1990s. Over a century horizon, the real story may be less about tariffs and more about technology: modern electric-arc furnaces need a fraction of the labor that mid-20th-century blast furnaces did, so even a tariff-induced production uptick is unlikely to restore mass steel employment. Yet the decision accelerates the formation of rival trade blocs and could normalize 50 % duties as a policy tool—an echo of pre-1945 mercantilism that, if replicated, would reshape global supply chains far beyond metal pricing.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left-leaning U.S. and UK outlets (e.g., The New York Times, NPR, The Guardian, NBC, CBS)**: They frame the 50% steel and aluminum tariffs as a politically-motivated gambit that will inflate costs for consumers, harm downstream manufacturers and strain relations with allies. These publications often scrutinize Trump’s policies and may foreground worst-case economic projections and foreign criticism while giving less space to the domestic-industry argument that benefits their largely urban, globalist readerships.

- **Right-leaning U.S. media (e.g., The Western Journal)**: They praise the tariff hike as a tough, necessary step to counter unfair foreign dumping and secure American industrial and national-security interests. By echoing White House talking points and focusing on Canadian displeasure, this viewpoint downplays evidence of higher consumer prices or job losses that might undercut a nationalist economic narrative.

- **Canadian news outlets affected by the policy (e.g., Global News)**: They warn the doubled duties will inflict “mass disruption” on Canada’s steel and aluminum sectors and could devastate integrated North-American supply chains. Coverage is shaped by Canada’s economic stake, emphasizing domestic industry warnings and lobbying for exemptions while giving scant attention to U.S. arguments about security or industrial revival.
