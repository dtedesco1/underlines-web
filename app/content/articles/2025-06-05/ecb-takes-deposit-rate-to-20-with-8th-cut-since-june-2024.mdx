# ECB Takes Deposit Rate to 2.0 % with 8th Cut Since June 2024

On 5 June 2025, the European Central Bank trimmed all key rates by 25 bp, pushing the deposit facility to 2.0 % and signalling a probable summer pause after a year-long easing streak.

#### Focusing Facts

- Deposit rate reduced from 2.25 % to 2.00 % at the 5 June 2025 policy meeting.

- Move represents the eighth quarter-point cut executed in the 12-month cycle that began June 2024.

- Euro-area headline inflation printed at 1.9 % in May 2025, slipping under the ECB’s 2 % target for the first time in eight months.

#### Context

The ECB last compressed policy rates this quickly in 2012–14, when Mario Draghi took the deposit rate from 0.75 % to 0 % amid the sovereign-debt crisis; both episodes reveal how Europe habitually leans on monetary policy when fiscal coordination lags.  Today’s cut tracks a century-long pattern in which trade frictions—think Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930—push central banks toward easier money to offset collapsing cross-border demand.  The step also fits the post-2008 structural drift toward lower neutral rates as demographics, productivity and debt levels suppress inflationary pressure.  Whether this decision matters in 2125 will depend on if Europe’s politicians convert the breathing room into productivity-enhancing investment or, as in Japan after its early-1990s cuts, allow a low-rate environment to calcify economic sclerosis.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Global financial news wires (Reuters, Yahoo! Finance, Investing.com)**: Portray the ECB’s eighth consecutive rate cut as a largely technical, data-dependent response to inflation falling back to target, with policymakers signalling a possible pause while they assess incoming numbers. Their market-oriented coverage stresses the procedural, neutral nature of the move and may downplay the political drama or social fallout in order to keep the focus on forecasts, bond yields and trader expectations, consistent with the outlets’ mandate to inform investors.

Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ecb-cut-rates-again-case-220358952.html))

- **Left-leaning UK media (The Guardian, BBC)**: Frame the rate cut as a necessary defence against the economic damage wrought by Donald Trump’s trade wars, underscoring how tariffs have hammered euro-area growth and forced the ECB’s hand. By repeatedly foregrounding Trump’s role and quoting his social-media barbs, the coverage accentuates the political blame game and may over-attribute Europe’s slowdown to U.S. policy—an angle that resonates with these outlets’ typical scepticism toward conservative U.S. leadership.

- **U.S. cable news focus (CNN International)**: Treats the ECB cut chiefly as fresh ammunition in President Trump’s pressure campaign on the Federal Reserve, highlighting how Europe’s move could spark intensified attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This U.S-centric lens centres the story on American partisan dynamics and Trump’s rhetoric, potentially sidelining the ECB’s own eurozone considerations in order to appeal to an audience primed for domestic political drama.
