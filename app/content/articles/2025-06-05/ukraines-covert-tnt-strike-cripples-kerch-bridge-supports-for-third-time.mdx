# Ukraine’s Covert TNT Strike Cripples Kerch Bridge Supports for Third Time

Before dawn on 3 Jun 2025, Ukrainian agents remotely detonated roughly a metric ton of underwater explosives they had covertly installed over months, damaging the main support pillars of the 19-km Kerch Bridge and forcing repeated closures.

#### Focusing Facts

- First blast at 04:44 local time used ≈1,100 kg TNT, according to SBU video and statement.

- Traffic was halted twice on 3 Jun, including a four-hour shutdown, as Russian operators inspected structural damage.

- This is Ukraine’s third attack on the span after an October 2022 truck bomb and a July 2023 sea-drone strike.

#### Context

Modern wars still hinge on logistics; bridges become fulcrums.  In 1972 U.S. jets finally felled Vietnam’s Thanh Hóa bridge after 871 failed sorties—demonstrating persistence can outmatch even heavy fortifications.  Likewise, Kyiv’s methodical campaigns (2022 truck bomb, 2023 sea drones, 2025 submerged charges) show an evolutionary playbook: when missiles run short, sabotage, drones and underwater mining fill the gap.  The operation also exposes Moscow’s vulnerability in Crimea, echoing imperial overstretch from the 1854 Crimean War to the 1944 Axis retreat from Sevastopol.  Over a century horizon, control of Crimea’s land bridge has repeatedly signalled the rise or decline of regional hegemons; today’s blast, whether or not it renders the span unusable, underscores a trend toward inexpensive, decentralized precision strikes reshaping great-power contests and may foreshadow the peninsula’s ultimate geopolitical alignment.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Liberal international media (e.g., The Guardian, The Washington Post)**: Portrays the underwater strike as a major, months-long Ukrainian success that cripples a prestige symbol, shifts battlefield momentum and rebuts claims Kyiv is running out of options. Stories accentuate Ukrainian prowess and political messaging (changing the Trump-era “narrative,” eroding Russia’s strength) while glossing over the still-uncertain extent of bridge damage they cannot independently verify. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/03/ukraine-hits-bridge-linking-crimea-to-russia-with-underwater-explosives), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/03/russia-ukraine-crimea-bridge-blast-drones/))

- **Public service broadcasters (e.g., BBC, Australian Broadcasting Corporation)**: Acknowledge Ukraine’s claim but repeatedly stress that damage reports are unconfirmed, the bridge quickly reopened and Russia has not yet commented, presenting the strike within a wider exchange of attacks and stalled peace talks. The insistence on verification and inclusion of Russian updates cultivates a reputation for balance, yet the both-sides framing may dilute the strategic significance Kyiv seeks to highlight and underplay Ukrainian narratives. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz708lpzgxro?xtor=AL-72-%255Bpartner%255D-%255Binforadio%255D-%255Bheadline%255D-%255Bnews%255D-%255Bbizdev%255D-%255Bisapi%255D), [Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-06-03/ukraine-hits-crimea-bridge-with-underwater-explosives/105373372))

- **U.S. tabloid conservative media (e.g., New York Post)**: Declares the operation a “devastating” Ukrainian blow that severed the only bridge linking Russia to Crimea, showcasing dramatic video and explosive tonnage. Sensational language and certainty about catastrophic impact serve headline drama and partisan hawkishness, risking exaggeration of facts that other outlets treat cautiously.
