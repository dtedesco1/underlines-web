# US Veto Blocks UNSC 14-1 Gaza Cease-Fire Resolution

On 4 June 2025 the United States cast the Council’s lone negative vote, using its veto to stop a draft that would have mandated an “immediate, unconditional and permanent” Gaza cease-fire and free flow of aid.

#### Focusing Facts

- Draft garnered 14 votes in favour—including the UK, France, Russia and China—but failed because a single U.S. veto suffices to kill any measure.

- This was the Trump administration’s first Gaza-war veto and the fifth U.S. cease-fire veto since October 2023.

- All ten elected members (the E-10) co-sponsored the text: Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia and Somalia.

#### Context

The move echoes 29 July 1970, when the U.S. first used its veto to shield Israel, and 18 Dec 2017, when Washington again stood 14-to-1 isolated over Jerusalem—showing a half-century pattern of great-power vetoes trumping broad consensus. Structurally, the incident spotlights the Security Council’s Cold-War-era design that lets any P-5 capital protect a client state, much as Russia has shielded Syria since 2011 and China Myanmar since 2007. Politically, it widens the trans-Atlantic rift as even London backed the measure, suggesting a slow erosion of automatic Western alignment on Israel. Humanitarian leverage—aid withheld or channelled through militarised schemes—recalls the Biafra blockade of 1968-70: civilians starve while diplomacy stalls. Over a 100-year lens, repeated paralysis on Palestine fuels pressure to curtail the veto or shift legitimacy toward alternative forums like the General Assembly or ad-hoc coalitions, potentially redefining how collective security is practiced in the mid-21st century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The Guardian, The New York Times, France 24)**: Frame Washington’s lone veto as morally isolating and obstructive, stressing Gaza’s ‘catastrophic’ humanitarian crisis and depicting the failed resolution as the international community’s effort to stop Palestinian suffering. Stories foreground civilian tolls and famine warnings while giving scant space to Israeli or U.S. security arguments, reflecting a tendency to prioritise human-rights advocacy over the strategic concerns cited by Israel and the Trump administration.

- **Right leaning / pro-Israel media (e.g., Fox News, The Times of Israel, ynetnews)**: Portray the U.S. veto as principled solidarity with Israel, arguing the draft text ‘rewarded’ Hamas and ignored the terror group’s accountability for the war and the hostages’ plight. Coverage spotlights Hamas brutality and UN ‘bias’ against Israel while minimising or casting doubt on reports of mass Palestinian casualties and aid obstruction, aligning with conservative and Israeli government narratives.

- **UN-affiliated and multilateral outlets (e.g., UN News, Siasat Daily quoting UN diplomats)**: Emphasise near-consensus among Security Council members and lament that the veto prevents action amid looming famine, echoing UN officials’ warnings that aid is only a ‘trickle’. Reliant on statements from UN agencies and diplomats, the reporting largely adopts the institution’s humanitarian framing and may understate political complexities or criticisms that the resolution lacked balance toward Hamas.
