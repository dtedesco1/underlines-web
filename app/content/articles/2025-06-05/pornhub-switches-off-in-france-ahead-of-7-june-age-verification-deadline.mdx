# Pornhub Switches Off in France Ahead of 7 June Age-Verification Deadline

On 3-4 June 2025, Aylo abruptly blocked French access to Pornhub, YouPorn and RedTube in protest at France’s imminent law forcing porn sites to use credit-card or ID-based “double-anonymity” age checks.

#### Focusing Facts

- Cut-off started Wednesday 4 June 2025, three days before operators must comply with the new verification regime taking effect 7 June.

- Aylo says France accounts for roughly 7 million daily visits, making it Pornhub’s #2 market after the US.

- Regulator Arcom estimates 2.3 million French minors—about 12 % of total users—access porn sites monthly.

#### Context

Governments have long tried to police obscene material: Britain’s 1857 Obscene Publications Act or the U.S. 1996 Communications Decency Act both sought to shield youth, yet each triggered privacy and free-speech backlash. France’s 2025 mandate echoes the U.K.’s abandoned 2017–19 age-check plan that collapsed over data-security fears, and mirrors the patchwork U.S. state laws that prompted Pornhub blackouts in Utah (2023) and Texas (2024). The deeper trend is a shift from self-certification toward hard digital proof-of-age—a step toward broader online identity regimes advocated under the EU’s Digital Services Act. Whether device-level signals (favoured by Aylo) or government-approved third parties prevail will determine how much anonymity survives the commercial web. In a 100-year lens, this standoff is less about porn than about who controls digital identity infrastructure: platforms, states or operating-system giants. France’s gambit tests how far a medium-sized democracy can push global sites to adopt its standards, and the outcome will foreshadow future battles over age-gating, gambling, deepfakes and political speech across a borderless internet.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Tech and business media quoting Aylo (Bloomberg Business, TechSpot, POLITICO)**: Portray France’s age-verification mandate as privacy-threatening and ineffective, echoing Aylo’s call for device-level checks instead. Stories lean on company spokespeople and frame the dispute in terms of digital rights and business impact, giving limited weight to French child-protection arguments repeatedly cited by officials.

- **French officials and supportive francophone/European outlets (RFI, Le Monde, ProtoThema)**: Cast the suspension as proof that strict verification rules are necessary to shield millions of minors and say platforms are free to leave if they refuse the law. Messages emphasise moral duty and political victory, glossing over critics’ warnings about data security and portraying Aylo’s stance as mere obstructionism. ([RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20250604-porn-sites-go-dark-in-france-over-new-age-verification-rules), [Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/06/04/why-pornhub-is-suspending-access-in-france_6742005_13.html))

- **Public broadcasters covering EU regulation (BBC, Deutsche Welle)**: Frame the shutdown as part of a wider European clamp-down on porn sites that are under increasing regulatory scrutiny over child safety. While maintaining a balanced tone, reports largely mirror EU regulatory narratives and may underplay the practical privacy objections raised by the industry.
