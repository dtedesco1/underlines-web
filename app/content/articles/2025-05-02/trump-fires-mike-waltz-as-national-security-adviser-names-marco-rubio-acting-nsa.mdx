# Trump Fires Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser, Names Marco Rubio Acting NSA and Reassigns Waltz to UN Post

On 1 May 2025, President Trump removed National Security Adviser Mike Waltz over the March Signal-chat leak but, within hours, nominated him U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and installed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as interim NSA.

#### Focusing Facts

- Waltz and his deputy Alex Wong were dismissed from the National Security Council on 1 May 2025, six weeks after inadvertently adding journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a 13 March Signal chat that exposed details of 15 March strikes on Yemen’s Houthis.

- Minutes after the firing, Trump announced on Truth Social that Rubio would hold the unprecedented dual role of Secretary of State and acting National Security Adviser while Waltz awaits Senate confirmation as U.N. ambassador.

- The Atlantic leak prompted at least four other quiet NSC staff terminations confirmed by Trump on 3 April 2025.

#### Context

Presidents reshuffling security aides mid-crisis is not new—JFK dropped Gen. Cabell days after the 1961 Bay of Pigs, and Nixon made Henry Kissinger both NSA and Secretary of State in 1973—but the same-day firing-and-promotion of Waltz evokes Andrew Jackson’s 1831 ‘Kitchen Cabinet’ purge where loyalty trumped discipline. The episode underscores a 21st-century trend: personal digital tools (Signal, Venmo) turning into national-security vulnerabilities faster than bureaucracies can adapt. Over a century horizon, today’s rapid, personality-driven reassignments may matter less than the institutional precedent they set: normalising dual-hatted power concentrations and blurring consequences for security lapses, potentially incentivising future advisers to prize presidential favor over operational rigor—an echo of the patronage cycles the 1883 Pendleton Act sought to curb.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning media (e.g., Fox News)**: Presents Waltz’s exit as a routine shake-up that still reflects Trump’s confidence, stressing Waltz’s credentials and the quick move to elevate him to U.N. ambassador while downplaying the Signal-chat leak as an embarrassing but harmless mistake. Coverage repeatedly echoes White House talking points, minimizes the severity of the security breach and frames critics as partisan attackers, signaling an incentive to defend the Trump administration’s narrative.

- **Mainstream national outlets (e.g., CBS News, Yahoo News)**: Frame Waltz’s removal as the first major staff shake-up of Trump’s second term, driven by loss of confidence after a damaging Signal-chat leak that exposed sensitive war plans. Stories lean on anonymous officials and highlight West Wing ‘chaos,’ incentivizing emphasis on dysfunction and intra-administration drama to attract readership.

- **Progressive opinion press (e.g., The New Republic)**: Portrays the episode as another example of Trump’s blatant corruption and improvised cronyism, pointing to the multi-positioning of Rubio and Waltz’s scandals as evidence of systemic rot. Uses highly charged language (“open corruption,” “scheme”) that signals an ideological goal of discrediting Trump, potentially overstating motives and conflating separate issues.
