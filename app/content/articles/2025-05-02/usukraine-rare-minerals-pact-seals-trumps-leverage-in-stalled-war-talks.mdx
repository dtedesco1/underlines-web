# U.S.–Ukraine Rare-Minerals Pact Seals Trump’s Leverage in Stalled War Talks

On 30 April 2025 Washington and Kyiv finally inked a joint fund that grants U.S. companies development rights to Ukraine’s lithium, titanium, graphite and other critical minerals in return for reconstruction financing.

#### Focusing Facts

- Fund is intended to channel revenues to repay roughly $175 billion in prior U.S. aid and will be co-managed on a declared 50/50 basis.

- Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliya Sviridenko confirmed on 30 Apr 2025 that the “Minerals Cooperation Agreement” was signed, giving the U.S. exploration rights and future royalties over lithium, titanium and 17 rare-earth elements in exchange for investment via a joint Reconstruction Fund.

- White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated on 29 Apr 2025 that Trump may abandon the Saudi-brokered talks within a week if a permanent cease-fire framework is not accepted, after the U.S. had already frozen further arms deliveries in Feb 2025.

- Trump’s leaked cease-fire outline recognises Russia’s control of Crimea and current front lines, bars Ukrainian NATO membership, but imposes no troop-ceilings on Kyiv’s army.

#### Context

The arrangement evokes the 1948–52 Marshall Plan’s mix of aid and industrial access, yet just as much the 1872 Reuter concession in Qajar Persia that surrendered mineral rights to Britain before being rescinded. It illustrates two long-running currents: the 21st-century scramble for energy-transition minerals as the U.S. seeks to break China’s 90 % grip on rare-earth processing, and the older tendency of great powers to attach economic strings to security guarantees—from the Philippines’ Bell Act in 1946 to Iraq’s post-2003 oil auctions. Whether this deal will be remembered a century hence depends on governance: if the fund catalyzes diversified Ukrainian industry it could anchor sovereignty; if it locks Kyiv into exporting raw ore to service war debt it risks repeating a colonial extractive cycle that historians may cite as a cautionary footnote to the 2020s mineral rush.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning U.S. media (e.g., Fox News, Zero Hedge, NaturalNews.com)**: Trump’s cease-fire proposal and minerals agreement are portrayed as shrewd, necessary moves that could swiftly stop the bloodshed and spare American taxpayers while keeping Ukraine armed. Coverage praises Trump and minimizes that the plan cements Russian land grabs, reflecting partisan incentives to defend the Republican president and mock liberal critics rather than scrutinize risks for Kyiv.

- **Left leaning U.S./UK media (e.g., The New York Times, The Atlantic, Newsweek, inews.co.uk)**: Reporting warns that Trump’s push for a quick peace may sacrifice Ukrainian territory, reward Putin and let the U.S. walk away, exposing Europe to a prolonged war. Articles emphasize Trump’s inconsistency and alleged deference to Putin, mirroring longstanding ideological opposition to him and sometimes presuming his bad faith before talks conclude.

- **Russian state-owned media (RT)**: The minerals deal is framed as Washington grabbing Ukraine’s resources while cutting aid, underscoring U.S. exploitation and its leverage over Kyiv during Trump’s peace push. By depicting Ukraine as a pawn of American greed and ignoring Russia’s aggression, the narrative advances Kremlin talking points that shift blame away from Moscow. ([RT](https://www.rt.com/news/616573-minerals-deal-ukraine-trump/))

- **British mainstream broadcasters**: Describe a fraught, highly transactional negotiation where U.S. military aid was conditioned on mineral access, underscoring repeated delays, last-minute changes, and the power imbalance between Washington and Kyiv. By spotlighting negotiation drama and U.S. pressure, coverage may overplay tensions to craft a compelling diplomatic story while giving less space to potential economic upsides touted by both governments.
