# ICJ Opens Week-Long Hearings on Israel’s Gaza Aid Blockade and UNRWA Ban

Starting 28 April 2025, the International Court of Justice began five public days of testimony to decide whether Israel’s 2 March-imposed total aid cutoff and ban on UNRWA breach its legal duty to facilitate relief for Gaza’s 2.3 million residents.

#### Focusing Facts

- Israel has barred every truckload of food, fuel and medicine from entering Gaza since 2 March 2025, the enclave’s longest uninterrupted closure.

- Forty states and four international organisations are slated to speak before the ICJ’s 15 judges between 28 April and 2 May.

- Israel declined oral participation, instead submitting written objections and denouncing the process as “systematic persecution,” according to Foreign Minister Gideon Saar.

#### Context

This hearing echoes the court’s 2004 advisory opinion on Israel’s West Bank barrier—also ignored by Jerusalem—and earlier cases where great powers (e.g., the U.S. in the 1986 Nicaragua ruling) shrugged off ICJ findings.  Historically, starvation sieges—from Leningrad 1941-44 to the 1993-95 Bosnian war—galvanised norms that occupying forces must allow relief; the court is now asked to clarify whether 21st-century blockades that weaponise aid cross the same red line.  More broadly, the proceedings illustrate a century-long trend of “lawfare,” where states and NGOs shift battlefields into courtrooms as military asymmetries widen.  Even if non-binding, an opinion deeming the blockade illegal could accelerate diplomatic isolation, aid-conditionality debates, and domestic litigation in third countries, much as the 1971 Namibia opinion fed the global sanctions campaign against apartheid South Africa.  On a 100-year horizon, the case tests whether multilateral legal order retains teeth when confronted with a state that enjoys major-power backing; the answer will signal to future conflicts whether humanitarian obligations are enforceable norms or merely aspirational rhetoric.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International human-rights–focused and Arab-world outlets**: They frame Israel’s blockade as a deliberate "weapon of war" causing famine in Gaza and urge the ICJ to hold Israel legally responsible for violating its humanitarian obligations. Coverage foregrounds Palestinian suffering and UN condemnation while giving limited space to Israeli security claims, reflecting an advocacy tone that may understate Hamas’s role in diverting aid.

- **Israeli nationalist and security-oriented media**: They present Israel’s aid restrictions as a necessary measure to protect citizens and free hostages while dismissing the ICJ hearings as a politicized campaign that ignores Hamas’s exploitation of aid. Narratives emphasize Israeli grief and security imperatives, largely downplaying reported starvation in Gaza and portraying the UN process as inherently biased to bolster domestic unity and international sympathy.
