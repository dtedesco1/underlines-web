# Judge Refers Apple for Criminal Contempt Over App Store Anti-Steering Order

On 30 Apr 2025, District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found Apple in contempt for flouting her 2021 Epic v. Apple injunction, barred the firm from any fees on off-app payments, and sent Apple and VP Alex Roman to federal prosecutors for possible criminal charges.

#### Focusing Facts

- The 80-page ruling mandates Apple "effective immediately" drop its new 27 % fee and “scare screens,” freeing roughly 2 million U.S. App Store apps from those restrictions.

- Gonzalez Rogers sent Apple and Vice-President of Finance Alex Roman to federal prosecutors after finding Roman lied under oath and CEO Tim Cook ignored internal advice to comply.

- Apple’s App Store generated an estimated US$100 billion in annual revenue, with services revenue hitting US$92 billion in 2024.

- Epic Games says Fortnite will return to the U.S. iOS App Store the week of 6 May 2025 if Apple complies.

#### Context

Tech antitrust battles rarely escalate to criminal referrals; the last comparable U.S. flash-point was the 1998–2001 Microsoft case, when executives risked perjury over Internet Explorer bundling, yet no criminal probe ensued.  The new contempt threat signals a shift: courts are willing to punish platform gatekeepers personally when they sabotage mandated openness, echoing early-20th-century crackdowns on Standard Oil (1911) for monopolistic tactics.  It reflects two converging trends—the global push (EU DMA, Japan’s Act on Improving Transparency) to curb digital toll-booths, and U.S. judges’ impatience with “malicious compliance.”  Whether prosecutors act or settle, the order matters because it punctures the aura that trillion-dollar tech firms can simply pay fines and delay.  On a 100-year arc, this could mark the moment U.S. courts reassert contempt powers over digital monopolies, laying precedent that gatekeeping code can be policed like railroads or pipelines— or it may fade if the Justice Department declines, showing the limits of judicial muscle against corporate giants.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Tech and gaming press (e.g., The Verge, PC Gamer, Ars Technica)**: They frame the ruling as a decisive victory for Epic Games and developers, underscoring that Apple knowingly lied and that its App Store "tax" has been severely undermined. Coverage tends to amplify Apple’s wrongdoing and celebrate the upset to the App Store model, a stance that resonates with their developer- and gamer-oriented audiences and drives attention-grabbing headlines.

- **Apple-focused media (e.g., AppleInsider, 9to5Mac)**: They highlight Apple’s statement that it "strongly disagrees" with the decision and plans to appeal, stressing the company’s options and possible next steps while noting the legal risks. Because their readership and access revolve around Apple’s ecosystem, they center Apple’s perspective and potential damage control, which can under-emphasize the broader antitrust implications raised by the court.

- **Mainstream and business news outlets (e.g., BBC, CNBC, Reuters-syndicated Malay Mail)**: They focus on the judge’s finding of willful non-compliance, the referral for possible criminal contempt, and the immediate operational consequences for Apple. In pursuing broad audience appeal they spotlight the legal drama and financial stakes but offer limited exploration of how the ruling reshapes developer competition or consumer choice.
