# China Retaliates with 34% Tariff on US Goods Amid Trade Escalation

On April 10, 2025, China enforces a 34% tariff on all US imports in direct retaliation to Trump's recently imposed reciprocal tariffs, deepening the US-China trade conflict.

#### Focusing Facts

- China’s Tariff Commission announced a 34% tariff on US goods, effective April 10, 2025.

- Trump's administration introduced a 10% universal tariff with specific 34% tariffs on China and other targets.

- China also initiated export controls on rare earths and added US firms to export restrictions and unreliable entities lists.

#### Context

This escalation recalls historical instances like the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which, by imposing steep tariffs during economic downturn, contributed to global contraction and realignment of trade practices. The current move, emerging after years of intermittent trade tensions that surged during Trump's previous term, reflects long-term shifts toward economic nationalism and protectionism. While the immediate effects might disrupt supply chains and elevate consumer prices, over a century such reciprocal tariff and export control tactics could reshape global trade alliances and signal a move away from the post-WWII multilateral order, ultimately redrawing the contours of international economic relations.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US right-leaning media**: They support Trump’s tariffs as a bold, necessary stand against what they see as China’s overreaction and economic bullying. This perspective often emphasizes strong nationalist and free-market rhetoric, possibly downplaying any adverse repercussions of aggressive trade policies.

- **Chinese state-owned media**: They portray the US tariffs as unilateral bullying that violates trade rules and defend the retaliatory 34% tariff as a justified measure to protect national interests. This narrative is influenced by government positions that focus on sovereignty and national pride, potentially overlooking the broader economic impacts and the benefits of engagement.

- **International/multilateral media**: They criticize unilateral tariff policies for sparking trade wars that harm global economic stability and advocate for dialogue and multilateral solutions. This approach may understate national interests and the strategic use of tariffs, emphasizing global cooperation over domestic policy imperatives.
