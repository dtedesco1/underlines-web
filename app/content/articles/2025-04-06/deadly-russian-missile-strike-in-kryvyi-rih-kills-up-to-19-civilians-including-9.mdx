# Deadly Russian Missile Strike in Kryvyi Rih Kills Up to 19 Civilians, Including 9 Children

On April 4-5, 2025, a Russian ballistic missile hit a residential area in Ukraine’s Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of President Zelenskyy, resulting in up to 19 deaths and over 60 injuries.

#### Focusing Facts

- On April 4-5, a missile strike in Kryvyi Rih killed 19 people, including nine children, and injured as many as 68 individuals.

- The attack hit civilian infrastructure near residential blocks and a playground, with significant damage to at least 20 apartment buildings and several public facilities.

- Russian officials claimed the strike targeted a military meeting, alleging 85 enemy casualties and 20 destroyed vehicles—a claim refuted by Ukrainian authorities.

#### Context

Historically, this strike is reminiscent of past conflicts where civilian areas were targeted to undermine morale, such as the Blitz during WWII (1940-1941) and urban bombings during the Balkan conflicts (1990s). Current long-term trends indicate a worrisome normalization of indiscriminate warfare amid stalled peace talks and shifting diplomatic maneuvers, such as recent US-brokered ceasefire efforts that have faltered. While this incident inflames immediate public outrage and fuels ongoing debates over war ethics and strategic objectives, its impact may eventually be absorbed into the broader historical narrative of warfare technology and political realignments over the coming century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International Mainstream Media**: They condemn the missile strike as an indiscriminate attack on civilians and residential areas, emphasizing the human tragedy and calling for increased international pressure on Russia. They rely heavily on Ukrainian official accounts and may frame the events primarily to galvanize Western public opinion against Russia.

- **Right-Leaning/Conservative Media**: They emphasize the brutal and shocking details of the attack, highlighting the high casualty figures and critiquing what they see as a weak response from Western allies, particularly the US. They tend to use sensational language and focus on assigning blunt blame, sometimes to reinforce a narrative of political failure or to question the adequacy of Western policies.
