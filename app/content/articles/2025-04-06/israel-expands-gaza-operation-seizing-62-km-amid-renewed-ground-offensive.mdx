# Israel Expands Gaza Operation: Seizing 62 km² amid Renewed Ground Offensive

On April 2-3, 2025, Israel dramatically escalated its military offensive in Gaza by ordering mass evacuations and committing to seize extensive territories to form new security zones, intensifying both ground and aerial assaults.

#### Focusing Facts

- Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz announced plans on April 2, 2025 to incorporate seized Gaza land—already reaching 62 km² since October 2023—into Israel’s security zones.

- Since resuming operations on March 18, 2025, Palestinian casualty figures have surged, with at least 1,066 deaths reported in recent days and isolated airstrikes, such as one on a school, killing 27-33 people.

- A Costs of War report noted that amid the renewed operation, at least 232 journalists have been killed, marking the deadliest period for conflict reporters in modern history.

#### Context

This expansion mirrors historical military strategies where states have redrawn boundaries through force, such as the British actions during the Anglo-Irish War (1919-1922). The use of forced evacuations and land seizures to create buffer zones is a recurring tactic in asymmetric warfare. Over the next century, these measures, while temporarily shifting control, tend to entrench conflicts and displace civilian populations permanently, reflecting long-term trends in modern military occupation and the persistent challenges in balancing security with humanitarian obligations.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Pro-Israel Security Advocates**: This group frames the military expansion as a necessary, proactive measure to eliminate terrorist threats, secure hostages, and safeguard national security amid ongoing conflict. Their narrative tends to downplay civilian casualties and emphasize security imperatives, potentially justifying aggressive operations over humanitarian concerns.

- **Humanitarian Critics**: This group highlights the severe collateral damage, civilian casualties, and humanitarian crisis resulting from the military operations in Gaza. Their coverage may focus on the human cost and frame the actions as disproportionate, possibly minimizing the stated security rationale behind the operations.

- **Diplomatic Moderates**: This group advocates for a return to serious negotiations and ceasefire efforts as the only path to a sustainable, political resolution to the conflict. Their emphasis on diplomacy may understate the immediate security concerns or operational imperatives, aligning more closely with international pressure for restraint.
