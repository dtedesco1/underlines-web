# TikTok divestment deal stalls as Trump's tariffs spark Chinese veto

After nearly finalizing a deal to spin off TikTok's US operations with less than 20% Chinese ownership, China rejected approval following new US tariffs, prompting Trump to extend the deadline by 75 days.

#### Focusing Facts

- The proposed deal would spin off TikTok’s US operations into a new company, reducing Chinese ownership to below 20%, and had investor and government approval.

- New US tariffs boosted total duties on Chinese imports to 54%, directly triggering Beijing’s refusal to endorse the divestment.

- The original divestiture deadline was initially set for January 19, but has been extended twice by 75 days by President Trump.

#### Context

This episode mirrors earlier economic confrontations where geopolitical pressures and trade tariffs have disrupted cross-border business deals, such as the 2018 US-China tariff disputes. Unlike the 2020 attempt to ban TikTok on national security grounds, this instance focuses on forced divestment amid reciprocal tariff maneuvers, reflecting long-term tensions in trade policy that echo historical protectionist measures like those seen during the Smoot-Hawley era (1930s). In the grand sweep of history, these repeated extensions and standoffs indicate a persistent struggle in reconciling national security with global trade dynamics—a tension likely to shape international commerce policy for decades to come.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Trump-advocating media**: These outlets emphasize Trump’s proactive extension as a strategic and bold move to save TikTok, underscoring his use of tariffs as effective leverage in negotiations with China. They tend to portray Trump's actions in a very positive light, potentially downplaying ongoing national security concerns and the complexities at play in trade negotiations.

- **Trade and business analysis media**: This group focuses on the deal’s collapse and the uncertainty introduced by China's tariff reaction, stressing that the negotiations are mired in broader trade war conflicts and economic risks. They may overemphasize the disruption caused by tariffs and understate the potential for strategic negotiation, highlighting complexities that align with a more skeptical view of rapid political fixes.
