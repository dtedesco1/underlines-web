# JWST Data Doubles 2024 YR4 Moon Impact Odds to 3.8% for Dec 2032

New observations from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope recalibrated asteroid 2024 YR4’s trajectory, eliminating the Earth impact threat while raising the Moon collision probability from 1.7% to 3.8% on December 22, 2032.

#### Focusing Facts

- Updated JWST infrared data measured the asteroid at approximately 60 meters in diameter.

- Earth impact risk was reduced to 0.004%, with the focus shifting to a potential lunar impact.

- Follow-up observations are scheduled for May 2025 before the asteroid vanishes into deep space.

#### Context

Historically, recalibration of impact probabilities—reminiscent of the 1908 Tunguska event's legacy—has led to major shifts in planetary defense strategies. The updated risk profile for 2024 YR4, now targeting the Moon rather than Earth, underscores the advancements in observational technology since the Apollo era when lunar mapping and impact studies began in earnest. This recalculated risk fits into a long-term trend of improving our ability to predict and mitigate near-Earth object threats, a process that over the next century will continue to refine our understanding of space hazards and their implications for both Earth and its natural satellite.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream Science Reporting**: These outlets present the recalculated risks of asteroid 2024 YR4 hitting the Moon as a routine update rooted in refined data from NASA and advanced telescopes like the JWST, emphasizing that the overall danger remains very low. They rely on official NASA figures and technical details, which may downplay uncertainty and are tied to institutional credibility.

- **Sensationalist Media**: This group highlights the 'city-killer' label and dramatic potential of the asteroid impact, often using provocative language to underscore a narrative of looming, catastrophic events. They tend to amplify dramatic aspects for reader engagement, sometimes at the expense of nuanced scientific context.
