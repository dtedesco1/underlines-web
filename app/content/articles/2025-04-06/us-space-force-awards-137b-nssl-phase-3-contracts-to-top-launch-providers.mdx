# US Space Force Awards $13.7B NSSL Phase 3 Contracts to Top Launch Providers

The US Space Force has finalized multibillion-dollar contracts awarding 54 critical national security launches through 2029 to SpaceX, ULA, and Blue Origin under the NSSL Phase 3 Lane 2 program.

#### Focusing Facts

- SpaceX secured approximately $5.9 billion for 28 launches, reflecting its rapid cadence with 140 launches in the past year.

- ULA received about $5.4 billion for 19 missions while Blue Origin was awarded roughly $2.4 billion for 7 missions, marking its entry in critical national security space launches.

- The contracts span fiscal years 2025-2029, with mission assignments launching from key sites in Florida and California.

#### Context

This award marks a significant shift in the US military's space procurement strategy, resembling the transformative shifts of the 1980s when technological innovation reshaped defense contracts. Historically dominated by legacy providers under ULA’s Atlas V and Delta IV, the advent of SpaceX’s competitive launch cadence since its breakthrough in 2015 has reconfigured national security space acquisition. The diversification, including Blue Origin’s nascent but promising New Glenn vehicle, points to a long-term trend towards more resilient, cost-effective, and agile public-private partnerships in space. Over a century-long perspective, this move may parallel major defense modernizations that not only anticipate near-term operational needs but also recalibrate the strategic balance in an era with growing global competition in space capabilities.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream Global Media Reporting**: Reports in this group focus on the technical and strategic dimensions of the Pentagon’s launch contracts, emphasizing improved national security, enhanced resiliency in space, and the technological superiority of U.S. providers. They tend to stress official narratives and operational readiness, possibly underplaying political entanglements and conflicts of interest to reinforce the view of a well-oiled defense industrial process.

- **Political-Critical Business Analysts**: This group highlights the political and commercial dimensions, scrutinizing the influence of high-profile figures like Elon Musk and questioning the intertwining of government contracts with political favoritism and potential conflicts of interest. Their coverage may overemphasize political maneuvering and critiques of business-government ties, potentially overshadowing the technical merits and strategic needs of the contracts.
