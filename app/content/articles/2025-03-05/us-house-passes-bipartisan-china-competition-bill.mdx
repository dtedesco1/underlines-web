# US House Passes Bipartisan China Competition Bill

On October 5, 2023, the US House approved H.R. 4521 targeting China’s growing economic influence, marking a tangible shift in legislative strategy.

#### Focusing Facts

- Bill passed 68-32 on October 5, 2023.

- At least 18 Republican representatives joined Democrats in supporting the measure.

#### Context

This legislative move echoes historical patterns where rising economic competitors spurred decisive policy shifts. Comparable to the Reagan-era interventions during Japan’s ascendancy in the early 1980s—particularly following the 1985 Plaza Accord addressing trade imbalances—the current bill reflects a long-standing bipartisan approach to recalibrating economic strategy. Over decades, such measures have been incremental steps in the ongoing US effort to manage global economic rivalries; while significant in the short term, on a centennial scale these shifts tend to represent adjustments within larger, evolving systems rather than radical realignments.
