# US House Approves $10B Tech Countermeasures Bill Targeting China

On October 5, 2023, the U.S. House advanced H.R. 4521, a bill designed to redirect federal funds towards semiconductor research and other tech innovations to counter China's growing influence.

#### Focusing Facts

- The bill passed with a vote of 228â€“187.

- It earmarks approximately $10 billion in funding over a five-year period.

- The Senate is scheduled to review the measure within the next three weeks.

#### Context

Historically, legislative measures like this have mirrored moments of intense rivalry, reminiscent of Cold War policies such as the U.S. Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949, which redirected resources to maintain strategic advantages. This bill reflects a long-term systemic trend of leveraging fiscal policy to counter emerging geopolitical threats, underscoring how governments have repeatedly used technological investment as a bulwark against shifting global power structures. In the century-long arc of international relations, while such bills mark punctuated efforts to remold economic and security paradigms, their enduring impact is subject to the broader evolution of global interdependence and rivalry.
