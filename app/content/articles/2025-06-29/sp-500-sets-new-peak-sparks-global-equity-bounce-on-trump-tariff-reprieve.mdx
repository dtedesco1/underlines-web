# S&P 500 Sets New Peak, Sparks Global Equity Bounce on Trump Tariff Reprieve

On 27 June 2025 the S&P 500 pierced a fresh intraday record, triggering synchronized gains from Singapore to Sydney after President Trump signalled delays and roll-backs to his July tariff package and scrapped the planned “revenge tax.”

#### Focusing Facts

- The S&P 500 opened at 6,155.66 on 27 June, eclipsing its prior 6,147.43 intraday high set on 19 February 2025—up 23 % from its April low.

- Singapore’s STI rose 0.7 % (＋27.74 pts) to 3,966.2 on 1.8 b shares worth S$1.4 b, mirroring Wall Street’s overnight rally.

- Australia’s ASX 200 added roughly A$15 bn in market value, climbing 0.5 % after the White House said the July 9 tariff deadline could be pushed back and Section 899 “revenge tax” would be scrapped.

#### Context

Market surges on executive jaw-boning are hardly new. After the 1962 “Kennedy Slide,” a single White House press conference halted a 25 % market drop; in August 2019 tweets on US-China tariffs swung the Dow 800 points intraday. June 2025 fits this pattern: policy signals, rather than fundamentals, are dictating capital flows. The rally sits atop conflicting currents—record-high public debt, softening consumer demand (US personal spending −0.1 % in May), and shrinking Canadian GDP (−0.1 % in April)—echoing 1998’s post-LTCM euphoria that preceded the 2000 dot-com bust. Over a 100-year lens, the episode illustrates the growing financialization of politics: instantaneous, global feedback loops where a tariff hint in Washington can add or erase tens of billions in Sydney, Dublin or Lagos within hours. Whether this proves a durable bull leg or another policy-driven whiplash will hinge on structural drivers—productivity, demographics, debt sustainability—not on the next presidential sound bite.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International financial press (e.g., Financial Times, The Irish Times)**: Interprets the surge to record-high stock indices as proof that trade tensions are easing and that robust earnings plus likely U.S. rate cuts will keep the bull market alive. By catering to investors, these outlets accentuate upside catalysts and may gloss over soft economic data that could undercut the rally.

- **Outlets highlighting recession warning signs (e.g., Firstpost, Global News)**: Treats falling consumer spending, shrinking income and negative GDP prints as signs tariffs are biting and a U.S-led downturn is looming. Fear-laden framing attracts clicks and can overstate downside risks while giving scant attention to simultaneous market rebounds.
