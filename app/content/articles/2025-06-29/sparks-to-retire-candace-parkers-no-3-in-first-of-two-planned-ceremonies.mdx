# Sparks to Retire Candace Parker’s No. 3 in First of Two Planned Ceremonies

On the weekend of 28–29 June 2025, Los Angeles will raise Candace Parker’s No. 3 jersey, beginning a rare two-franchise retirement of the WNBA icon’s number.

#### Focusing Facts

- Parker’s Sparks jersey will be retired at Crypto.com Arena during L.A.’s home game this weekend, less than a year after her 2024 retirement announcement.

- A second jersey retirement by the Chicago Sky is already scheduled for later in 2025, making Parker the first WNBA player honored by two teams in the same year.

- Since hanging up her sneakers, Parker has become Adidas’s President of Women’s Basketball and a full-time TV analyst, underscoring her off-court influence.

#### Context

Dual jersey retirements echo Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 1989-1990 number raisings by both the Lakers and Bucks, signalling a career that transcended a single market. Historically, WNBA franchises have been slow to institutionalise player legacies—Lisa Leslie’s 2013 Sparks ceremony came 13 years after the NBA’s first wave in the late 1990s—so compressing two honours into one season shows the league’s accelerating push to cement its heritage. The move also speaks to a broader 21st-century trend: women athletes leveraging post-career business roles (see Serena Williams’s VC firm, 2019) to maintain cultural relevance. In the long arc, formal recognition of women’s sports legends is a key step in building durable multi-generational fandom; 100 years from now, these ceremonies may mark the moment the WNBA fully embraced its own history rather than borrowing gravitas from the NBA.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Local business leadership (e.g., Greater Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce)**: A record-long ski season at Arizona Snowbowl is unequivocally good news, bringing visitors and revenue that help mountain-town shops, hotels and restaurants thrive. Because their membership’s profits rise with tourism, they gloss over any environmental or community concerns that might come with ever-longer ski seasons and heavy resort development.

- **Progressive cost-of-living activists (e.g., Zohran Mamdani and allies)**: Surging day-to-day expenses for housing, food and transit show the current economic model is failing ordinary New Yorkers and demands sweeping change. As this message is delivered on the campaign trail, the rhetoric likely spotlights hardship and underplays existing assistance programs to galvanize political support.
