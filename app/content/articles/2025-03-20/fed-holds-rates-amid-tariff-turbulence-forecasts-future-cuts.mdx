# Fed Holds Rates Amid Tariff Turbulence, Forecasts Future Cuts

On March 19, 2025, the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark rate at 4.25%-4.5% while signaling plans for two rate cuts later in the year as it grappled with economic uncertainty from Trump's aggressive tariff policies.

#### Focusing Facts

- The Fed maintained rates at 4.25%-4.5% on March 19, 2025, as part of a wait-and-see approach amid rising trade war-related pressures.

- Updated projections now forecast GDP growth at 1.7% and core inflation at 2.7% for 2025, a downgrade from previous estimates of 2.1% and 2.5% respectively.

- The Fed’s dot plot showed a split among officials, with 15 predicting two rate cuts this year, and actions like slowing Treasury drawdown from $25 billion to $5 billion monthly starting in April.

#### Context

This decision echoes the challenges faced during past periods of stagflation, such as the 1973-1975 era when external shocks (like the oil crisis) forced policymakers to balance inflation control and economic growth. The Fed’s cautious stance reflects long-term trends where central banks must navigate policy uncertainty amid disruptive trade actions. The current environment, marked by aggressive tariff moves and workforce cuts initiated by policy shifts under the Trump administration, is reshaping economic forecasts. Over a 100-year scale, such interventions have repeatedly tested the resilience of monetary policy, underscoring a recurring pattern where external economic shocks force difficult choices between supporting employment and containing inflation.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business-Focused Outlets**: They present the Fed’s decision as a measured, technical reaction to economic uncertainty driven largely by Trump’s tariff policies, emphasizing data points like unchanged rates and anticipated future cuts. Their analysis emphasizes market mechanics and forecasts with less critique of administration policies, potentially downplaying political controversies to focus on economic indicators.

- **Traditional Political Newspapers**: They interpret the Fed’s actions as being under undue strain from Trump’s disruptive tariff strategy, highlighting a dangerous trade-off between containing inflation and protecting jobs. Their coverage tends to be more critical of Trump’s policies, potentially overstating the negative impacts of tariffs and the administration’s erratic policy shifts.
