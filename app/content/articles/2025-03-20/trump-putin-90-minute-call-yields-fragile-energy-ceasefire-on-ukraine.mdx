# Trump-Putin 90-Minute Call Yields Fragile Energy Ceasefire on Ukraine

On March 18, during a 90-minute phone conversation, President Trump and President Putin agreed to a narrowly scoped 30-day pause on attacks against Ukrainian energy infrastructure, but the deal quickly unraveled with renewed hostilities.

#### Focusing Facts

- The call, lasting over 90 minutes on March 18, resulted in a 30-day ceasefire limited to energy and infrastructure targets.

- Putin conditions a broader peace on ending foreign military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, a term that Ukraine and its allies have repeatedly rejected.

- Within hours after the call, both sides resumed airstrikes, with Russian drones striking Ukrainian civilian sites, demonstrating the ephemeral nature of the truce.

#### Context

This episode mirrors earlier historic moments where partial agreements provided only momentary relief without resolving underlying conflicts—akin to the tentative truces of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, which offered only a temporary pause in fighting. The deal illustrates long-term systemic challenges in negotiation processes where superpowers leverage minimal concessions to maintain strategic advantages. Over a century, similar events have shown that while short-term pauses can create space for diplomatic maneuvering, they often fail to address fundamental power imbalances, leaving the region mired in recurring cycles of conflict. This moment matters because it reinforces the enduring difficulty of aligning national interests in a multipolar world, with significant implications for regional security and the future of international order.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: They portray Trump’s phone call with Putin as a proactive and productive diplomatic move that has secured a promising, if partial, ceasefire while contrasting his decisive action with Biden’s inaction. This perspective may overstate Trump’s achievements and downplay the risks of negotiating with Putin, favoring a partisan narrative that lauds his leadership.

- **Left leaning media**: They are highly skeptical of the Trump–Putin engagement, arguing that the call’s limited concessions expose vulnerabilities and risk compromising Ukraine’s sovereignty for personal or political gain. This view is colored by ideological opposition to Trump and distrust of his willingness to negotiate on terms detrimental to Ukraine’s long-term interests.

- **International mainstream media**: Outlets like BBC and CNBC report the call factually—acknowledging a partial ceasefire on energy and infrastructure while noting that significant conditions and challenges remain for any comprehensive peace. While aiming for balanced reporting, this perspective may lean toward the established Western diplomatic narrative and underemphasize the underlying strategic concessions.
