# BYD Unleashes 5-Minute Ultra-Fast Charging with Super E Platform

On March 18, 2025, BYD unveiled its Super E Platform boasting a 1,000 kW charging system that adds 400 km of range in just 5 minutes, intensifying competitive pressure on Tesla.

#### Focusing Facts

- BYD's new system delivers 1,000 kW charging, achieving 400 km (249 miles) range in 5 minutes.

- BYD announced plans to build over 4,000 megawatt flash charging stations across China.

- Tesla's superchargers, peaking at 250-500 kW, coincided with a near 4.8% drop in its stock.

#### Context

Historically, transformative innovations like Ford's assembly line in 1913 or the revolutionary rollout of the internet in the 1990s have redefined entire industries. BYD’s rapid-charging breakthrough echoes such pivotal moments by challenging entrenched norms in the automotive sector. This development not only signals a shift towards much faster charging solutions but also reshapes long-term market dynamics, emphasizing efficiency and consumer convenience that could recalibrate the global EV race over the next century.
