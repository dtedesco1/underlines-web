# Trump's Tariff Tussle Sparks 'Recession by Design' Warning

Aggressive tariff policies and erratic economic planning by President Trump in early 2025 have jolted markets, with economists warning that continued measures could deliberately engineer a recession.

#### Focusing Facts

- UCLA Anderson issued its first-ever 'Recession Watch' in 73 years, warning deep recession if current policies persist.

- The S&P 500 suffered a 10% correction, erasing approximately $5 trillion in market value within a month.

- U.S. unemployment in February ticked up from 4.0% to 4.1% even as 151,000 jobs were added.

#### Context

This episode echoes historical downturns such as the 2007–09 recession and the stagflation of the 1970s. Trump's trade wars, marked by unilateral tariffs (e.g., a 25% rate on Canadian and Mexican imports and additional tariffs on China), combined with abrupt policy shifts, reflect a deliberate push into economic contraction—a 'recession by design.' Over the long horizon of 100 years, such politically driven economic experiments risk undermining established market cycles and historical resets, potentially recasting fiscal policy and global trade norms without the natural corrections seen in past crises.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Economists Critiquing Trump’s Policies**: These articles argue that Trump's aggressive tariff measures and unpredictable policy moves are deliberately steering the economy toward a recession, a 'recession by design.' They may overstate the direct impact of policy decisions on economic outcomes to support a political critique, potentially neglecting other market factors.

- **Cautious Mainstream Economic Analysts**: This group acknowledges economic warning signs like tariff uncertainty and mixed data indicators but notes that technical definitions and robust job data mean a recession hasn't fully materialized yet. Their balanced tone might downplay risks, possibly reflecting institutional caution or an aversion to politicizing economic forecasts.

- **Housing Market Observers**: These articles focus on how Trump's policies and potential recession fears are impacting the housing market, emphasizing reduced buyer confidence and rising construction costs. They concentrate narrowly on real estate implications, which may exaggerate housing vulnerabilities while ignoring broader economic resilience factors.
