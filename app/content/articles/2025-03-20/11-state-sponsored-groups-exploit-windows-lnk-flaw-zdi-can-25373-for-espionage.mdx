# 11 State-Sponsored Groups Exploit Windows .lnk Flaw (ZDI-CAN-25373) for Espionage

Since 2017, 11 state-sponsored groups have exploited a flaw in Windows Shell Link files, using nearly 1000 malicious samples for cyber-espionage and data theft as detailed in 2025 research.

#### Focusing Facts

- Nearly 1000 malicious .lnk file samples exploiting ZDI-CAN-25373 were discovered in 2025.

- Exploitation has been carried out by groups from North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China since 2017, with nearly half of the attacks originating from North Korea.

- Microsoft declined to release a security patch following disclosure via Trend ZDI's bug bounty program.

#### Context

This event echoes the historical pattern of state-led cyber operations, reminiscent of early 2010 Stuxnet attacks that underscored the vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure. The exploitation of this Windows shortcut flaw highlights systemic issues in software patch management and the growing efficiency of state-sponsored hacking groups over recent decades. Just as Stuxnet and the 2003 SQL Slammer outbreak reshaped global cyber defense strategies, the current misuse of ZDI-CAN-25373 may spur long-term changes in cybersecurity protocols, further complicating the balance between technological innovation and national security over the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Cybersecurity-focused media**: This group emphasizes the technical details of the Windows shortcut flaw and highlights its exploitation by multiple state-sponsored threat groups, underscoring the real-world risks and the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity measures. Their analysis may be influenced by a focus on threat intelligence and market interests in promoting security solutions, potentially overstating the immediate danger to attract attention from enterprise and government clients.
