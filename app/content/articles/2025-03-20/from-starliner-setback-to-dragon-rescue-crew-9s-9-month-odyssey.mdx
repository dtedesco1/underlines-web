# From Starliner Setback to Dragon Rescue: Crew-9’s 9-Month Odyssey

NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, originally slated for an eight-day mission, stayed aboard the ISS for 286 days before returning home via SpaceX’s Dragon after Boeing’s Starliner encountered propulsion issues.

#### Focusing Facts

- Starliner launched on June 5, 2024, but technical propulsion problems forced NASA to leave it uncrewed on its return on Sept 7, 2024.

- Williams, Wilmore, along with Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov, splashed down off Florida on March 18, 2025 at 5:57 p.m. EDT after a 17-hour journey in the Dragon capsule 'Freedom'.

- Emerging political controversies saw President Trump and Elon Musk alleging that the Biden administration delayed the return for political reasons, despite NASA’s claims centered on safety and technical protocols.

#### Context

This event echoes historical crises like Apollo 13 in 1970, where technical mishaps forced mission improvisations that reshaped NASA's approach to space emergencies. Over nearly a century, space programs have periodically turned setbacks into milestones of operational adaptability, fostering a transition from government-only missions to public-private partnerships as seen with SpaceX’s growing role. Beyond the immediate drama, this incident reflects long-term trends toward increased reliance on commercial spacecraft for crewed missions, and serves as a reminder that political narratives can complicate technical and safety decisions, a dynamic that will likely persist as space exploration evolves.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning media**: Outlets like Fox News, New York Post, and PJ Media frame the astronauts' prolonged stay as a political failure attributed to the Biden administration, emphasizing praise for Trump’s intervention and Musk’s claims about political motives. They may exaggerate political narratives to delegitimize the opposing administration, focusing on partisan talking points over technical explanations.

- **Science and neutral coverage**: Outlets such as BBC and Space.com highlight the safe return of the astronauts by emphasizing technical challenges and planned NASA rescue operations without politicizing the event. They could understate any political controversy to maintain an image of factual, nonpartisan reporting, potentially overlooking valid criticisms of decision-making.
