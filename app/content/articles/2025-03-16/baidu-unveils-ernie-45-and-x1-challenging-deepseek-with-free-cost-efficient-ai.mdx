# Baidu Unveils ERNIE 4.5 and X1, Challenging DeepSeek with Free, Cost-Efficient AI

On March 16, 2025, Baidu launched two new AI models, ERNIE 4.5 and X1, to disrupt the competitive landscape by matching DeepSeek’s performance at a lower cost and offering free access via Ernie Bot.

#### Focusing Facts

- ERNIE X1 claims reasoning performance comparable to DeepSeek's R1 at half the cost.

- ERNIE 4.5 showcases advanced multimodal and language abilities, with high emotional intelligence for meme and satirical content interpretation.

- Ernie Bot's free release for individual users was accelerated by over two weeks from its original schedule.

#### Context

Baidu’s move echoes historical tech disruptions such as the 1981 launch of the IBM PC, which democratized computing and shifted market power by making high-quality technology accessible at lower costs. This event reflects a long-term trend towards open-source and user-centric design in technology, underlining a systemic shift where legacy companies must adapt or cede ground to more agile and cost-effective competitors. Over a 100-year timescale, these incremental innovations form the backbone of technological evolution, reinforcing or redefining market hierarchies much like the personal computer revolution did in the early 1980s.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International Business Media**: They report Baidu’s launch of ERNIE 4.5 and X1 as a strategic move in the global AI race, emphasizing its role in intensifying competition with both domestic startups like DeepSeek and international players. Their coverage relies heavily on official statements and industry-approved metrics, which might understate the challenges or downplay any inherent overstatements by Baidu.

- **Tech-Centric and Industry Analysis**: They focus on the disruptive impact of Baidu’s cost-efficient AI models and the strategic shift such as making chatbots free, framing it as a reaction to DeepSeek’s breakthrough in an evolving competitive landscape. This perspective may emphasize the ‘disruption’ narrative and competitive intrigue while glossing over deeper technical or operational challenges the company might face.
