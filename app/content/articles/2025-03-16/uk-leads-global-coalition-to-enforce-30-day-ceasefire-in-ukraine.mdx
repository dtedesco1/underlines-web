# UK Leads Global Coalition to Enforce 30-Day Ceasefire in Ukraine

On March 15, 2025, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer convened a virtual summit with around 25 world leaders to pressure Russia into accepting an immediate 30-day ceasefire while outlining plans for enhanced military support and sanctions.

#### Focusing Facts

- A 30-day interim ceasefire was agreed upon by Ukraine, with NATO, EU, and commonwealth partners pushing for enforcement measures.

- Russia, led by President Putin, set conditions including Ukraine abandoning NATO ambitions and ceding territories, while the US notably abstained from the summit.

- The coalition of the willing now includes commitments from nations as far as Japan, with plans to deploy peacekeepers if necessary.

#### Context

This event echoes historical coalition-building efforts, reminiscent of post-World War II alliances that sought to create security frameworks during turbulent times, such as the Marshall Plan era (1947-1952) and the early days of NATO (established 1949). It reflects a long-term trend where international bodies seek to enforce ceasefires as stepping stones towards broader peace, though history cautions that such alliances often face challenges when dealing with asymmetrical power dynamics and conditions that can prolong conflict. The insistence on tightly monitored ceasefire protocols and unified economic and military pressure indicates a shift toward proactive multilateralism that may reshape regional stability over the next century. This moment matters less for immediate win-lose calculations and more as an indicator of evolving norms of international security and collective responsibility in conflicts.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream Western coalition**: This group interprets the ongoing peace negotiations as part of a concerted international effort to pressure Russia—through sanctions, military support, and diplomatic isolation—into accepting a ceasefire and ultimately a just peace. They may overemphasize the righteousness of coordinated international pressure while downplaying complexities and dissenting views, aligning with strategic Western political interests.

- **Skeptical realists in tabloid commentary**: This group questions the optimistic tone of the coalition’s strategy, highlighting the possibility of ‘plan B’ scenarios in which Putin continues his stalling tactics or the ceasefire fails, emphasizing the pragmatic uncertainties behind the diplomatic pledges. Their analysis may lean toward skepticism of high-level diplomatic assurances and could be influenced by a desire to uncover shortcomings in the consensus, potentially overstating worst-case scenarios.
