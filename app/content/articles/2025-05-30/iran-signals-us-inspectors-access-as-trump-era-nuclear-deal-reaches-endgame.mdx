# Iran Signals U.S. Inspectors Access as Trump-Era Nuclear Deal Reaches Endgame

Between 28–30 May 2025 Tehran publicly offered to admit American IAEA inspectors and freeze enrichment in the sixth round of talks, a move that WH sources say precedes an imminent U.S.–Iran agreement to be unveiled in a Middle-East capital.

#### Focusing Facts

- On 28 May 2025, Iran’s nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami told a Tehran press conference that U.S. nationals on the IAEA team could enter Iranian facilities “if a deal is reached.”

- Negotiations led by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian FM Abbas Araghchi began in spring 2025 in Oman; CNN reports the draft accord will cut enrichment to 3.67 % and ship existing stockpiles to Russia.

- Israeli intelligence chiefs Dermer, Barnea and Binder have conducted shuttle diplomacy this month urging Trump to withhold any deal that blocks an Israeli strike window created by 26 Oct 2024 raids that disabled Iran’s S-300 defenses.

#### Context

Tehran’s offer evokes North Korea’s 1994 Agreed Framework, which also traded inspector access and plutonium caps for sanctions relief—an accord that collapsed within a decade and ultimately sped Pyongyang’s bomb.  Like JCPOA 2015, today’s draft reflects the post-Cold-War non-proliferation formula of temporary technical limits in exchange for economic reprieve, yet it now unfolds in a far less U.S.-centric, multipolar arena—note Moscow and Beijing openly coordinating with Iran while Washington debates extended deterrence amid calls for indigenous bombs in Tokyo and Seoul.  The moment matters because it tests whether incremental arms-control can survive when great-power rivalry, regional proxy wars, and rapid centrifuge advances shorten “break-out” timelines to weeks.  A century from now, historians may see 2025 either as the last successful patch on the NPT order or the point when regional actors concluded that possession, not promises, ensures security—tilting the planet toward normalized nuclear multipolarity.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli media**: They argue that Trump’s impending nuclear bargain, even with tougher headline concessions, would still let Iran sprint to a bomb within months and would deprive Israel of a rare window to strike first. With Israel’s security at stake, these outlets foreground worst-case threat assessments and discount diplomatic gains, amplifying fears to keep military options on the table.

- **U.S. right-leaning media**: They insist Tehran cannot be trusted and that any agreement must abolish all enrichment; otherwise Trump risks a dangerously weak deal that empowers America’s adversaries. Partisan hostility toward Iran and Democratic predecessors leads them to cast diplomacy as appeasement and magnify the influence of China and Russia to argue for maximal pressure.

- **Regional and non-Western outlets**: They depict Washington and Tehran as on the verge of a landmark accord that could relax sanctions, permit U.S. investment, and stabilize the region. Reliant on official briefings and eager for de-escalation, they highlight the deal’s upside while glossing over unresolved disputes on enrichment and verification.
