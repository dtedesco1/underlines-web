# Nvidia Q1 FY-26 Earnings: China Curbs Trigger Profit Miss Yet Shares Surge

On 29 May 2025, Nvidia reported a rare EPS shortfall and a $5.5 billion inventory write-down caused by fresh U.S. export controls on its H20 chips for China, but simultaneously raised ex-China guidance, sending the stock up about 5%.

#### Focusing Facts

- Fiscal Q1 revenue hit $44.1 billion, +69 % YoY and roughly $0.8 billion above Bloomberg consensus.

- Management warned of an $8 billion revenue hole in Q2 from the newly blocked China market, which it pegs at a $50 billion total addressable opportunity.

- The pre-market rally lifted Nvidia’s valuation back toward $3.3 trillion, erasing a nearly 30 % YTD drawdown logged in early April.

#### Context

Washington’s 2025 clamp-down echoes the CoCom semiconductor embargoes of the early 1980s, when U.S. policy tried to deny the Soviet bloc cutting-edge chips yet ultimately birthed parallel supply chains. Nvidia’s write-off illustrates the same decoupling dynamic now playing out between the U.S. and China. At a systems level, the episode signals two colliding trends: (1) the century-long pattern of compute cycles—mainframe (1960s), PC (1980s), cloud (2000s)—now pivoting to AI accelerators dominated by one firm; and (2) the re-politicization of critical tech supply, last seen in earnest during Cold-War industrial policy. Whether Nvidia becomes the next Intel of the 1990s or the next Cisco of 2000—soaring then stumbling—will hinge on how durable its moat remains once hyperscalers build their own silicon and national security walls keep shifting. In a 100-year frame, this moment may mark the fork where AI hardware fractures into competing geopolitical spheres, much as radio, nuclear tech and satellite networks once did, shaping both economic power and strategic leverage for decades.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Pro-growth Wall Street and financial media (Yahoo Finance upbeat coverage, bullish analysts)**: Portray Nvidia as the indispensable backbone of the AI revolution whose booming ex-China demand and fast Blackwell rollout keep its path to a $5 trillion valuation intact. By echoing bullish analyst notes and investor enthusiasm they generate market-friendly headlines and traffic, so they tend to skim over valuation risks and policy headwinds that could derail the story.

- **Skeptical or bearish investors and contrarian outlets**: Emphasize that Nvidia’s hype may be running ahead of fundamentals as export curbs, margin pressure and intensifying competition threaten a sharp slowdown. Highlighting worst-case scenarios and citing high-profile bears like Michael Burry courts attention and may overstate downside to stand out against the prevailing optimism. ([Yahoo!

- **Nvidia corporate view and industry critics of U.S. export controls**: Argue that new chip restrictions have ‘effectively closed’ a $50 billion China market, forcing multibillion-dollar write-downs and hurting American industry. The company has a direct financial stake in restoring China sales, so its messaging stresses lost revenue while sidestepping the national-security reasons behind the policy.
