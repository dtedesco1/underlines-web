# Moscow Sets 2 June Istanbul Meeting, Says Ceasefire Memorandum Ready

On 28-29 May 2025 Russia invited Ukraine to a second Istanbul round on 2 June, pledging to hand over its ceasefire memorandum after weeks of delay, a move Kyiv has not yet accepted.

#### Focusing Facts

- Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Medinsky delegation is "ready to present" Russia’s memorandum face-to-face in Istanbul on Monday, 2 June 2025.

- Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov confirmed Kyiv’s own document was submitted earlier and insisted Moscow share its version before the meeting.

- U.S. President Donald Trump gave Putin an informal two-week window, hinting at new sanctions if talks show no progress.

#### Context

Great-power wars often test whether battlefield momentum or negotiation tables dictate outcomes; the current gambit echoes the 1918 Brest-Litovsk talks where Russia, battered yet still fighting, sought a deal while fronts were fluid, and the 1968 Paris Vietnam talks where bombing continued even as diplomats met.  Structurally, the event fits a century-long pattern: combatants escalate violence to strengthen their bargaining position, then dangle diplomacy once external patrons—in this case Washington and Ankara—apply leverage.  Whether 2 June matters in 2125 hinges on if it freezes the map (as the 1953 Korean Armistice did, cementing borders for generations) or proves another performative pause that, like the 2014–15 Minsk accords, merely precedes renewed offensives.  The memorandum’s secrecy, Russia’s insistence on maximalist pre-conditions, and Ukraine’s demand for prior disclosure suggest the underlying power balance, not the venue, will decide if this becomes a durable pivot or a footnote in a protracted conflict shaping Europe’s security order for decades.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Outlets echoing Kremlin talking points (e.g., ProtoThema English, News18)**: Cast Moscow as the side earnestly drafting a ‘peace memorandum’ and striking only military targets while blaming NATO expansion and Kyiv’s laws for igniting the war. Heavy reliance on Russian officials’ quotes with little scrutiny lets Kremlin narratives dominate and downplays evidence of Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure.

- **Western mainstream media (e.g., Sky News, Reuters)**: Frame Russia’s Istanbul invitation as a possible stalling tactic, stressing Donald Trump’s mounting pressure and skepticism over Putin’s real intentions. Focus on U.S. and UK leaders’ leverage can inflate Western agency and may sideline Ukrainian perspectives or over-personalise complex diplomacy around Trump–Putin dynamics.

- **Middle-Eastern/Turkish outlets highlighting mediation (e.g., Al Jazeera, Yeni Şafak)**: Present the talks as a Turkish-facilitated diplomatic opening where Kyiv seeks an unconditional ceasefire and demands Russia submit its memorandum ahead of any meeting. By spotlighting Türkiye’s facilitator role and equalising both sides’ obligations, coverage can understate Russia’s battlefield escalation and amplify Ankara’s diplomatic stature.
