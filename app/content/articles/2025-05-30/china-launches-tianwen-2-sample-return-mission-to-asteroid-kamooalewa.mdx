# China Launches Tianwen-2 Sample-Return Mission to Asteroid Kamoʻoalewa

At 01:31 Beijing time on 29 May 2025, a Long March-3B successfully sent the 2.1-ton Tianwen-2 probe on a decade-long trek that will retrieve rocks from near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamoʻoalewa before heading to main-belt comet 311P.

#### Focusing Facts

- Launch time: 29 May 2025 01:31 CST (17:31 UTC 28 May) from Xichang, Sichuan.

- Return capsule is scheduled to deliver ≥100 g of asteroid samples to Earth in November 2027.

- After the Earth fly-by, the spacecraft will rendezvous with comet 311P/PANSTARRS around 2035 for close-up study.

#### Context

China’s bid echoes earlier milestones—Japan’s Hayabusa (2003-10) and NASA’s OSIRIS-REx (2016-23)—but folds both an asteroid return and a comet visit into one craft, something neither the 1970 Soviet Luna 16 lunar return nor ESA’s 2014 Rosetta comet orbiter attempted.  Over the past two decades, sample-return missions have morphed from proof-of-concept feats into strategic assets: they hone high-precision guidance, heat-shield, and autonomous-docking technologies that double as ballistic-missile and cislunar-logistics know-how.  Tianwen-2 thus signals not just scientific curiosity but China’s determination to acquire independent deep-space operational capability at a moment when U.S. budgets for planetary science are tightening and export-control barriers remain high.  On a 100-year horizon, such capability could reshape resource extraction, planetary-defense coordination, and geopolitical influence in cislunar space much as the 15th-century Ming treasure fleets briefly re-ordered Indian-Ocean trade.  Whether Tianwen-2 ultimately returns intact samples—or if economic headwinds curb the broader Tianwen roadmap—will determine if this launch is remembered as a stepping stone toward a multipolar Solar-System presence or a transient national prestige exercise.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Chinese state-owned media**: Portrays Tianwen-2 as a monumental stride toward Xi Jinping’s "space dream," proof that China is forging a new era of interplanetary exploration that will deliver groundbreaking scientific discoveries and national prestige. State outlets have an incentive to amplify success, gloss over the fact that Japan and the United States completed similar asteroid-sample missions first, and frame the venture as inevitable evidence of Chinese technological superiority.

- **US / Western science-tech media**: Frames the launch as a scientifically ambitious but also strategic move showing China rapidly narrowing the gap with NASA, while noting Beijing still trails earlier US and Japanese missions. Comparisons to past US achievements and mentions of looming NASA budget cuts subtly reassure Western readers of continued leadership yet sow concern over competition from China, reflecting a Washington-centric lens.

- **Global South & regional news outlets**: Casts the mission as a historic milestone that will make China only the third nation to return pristine asteroid samples, underscoring Asia’s growing role in cutting-edge space exploration. Highlighting China’s prowess bolsters a narrative of multipolar scientific progress, but these outlets largely sidestep geopolitical or security implications to keep coverage upbeat for non-Western audiences.
