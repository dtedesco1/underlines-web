# Israel Endorses Trump–Witkoff 60-Day Gaza Cease-Fire Draft; Hamas Signals Objections

Between 29–30 May 2025, Jerusalem accepted a U.S.–brokered cease-fire outline that would pause fighting for 60 days and start a hostage-prisoner swap, but Hamas said the text lacks a guarantee of permanent war-ending withdrawal and therefore remains unacceptable.

#### Focusing Facts

- White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated on 29 May that Israel had "signed off" on the proposal before it was forwarded to Hamas.

- The leaked draft calls for the release of 28 Israeli hostages (alive and dead) for 125 Palestinian prisoners and 180 bodies during the first week of the truce.

- Aid flows would resume immediately and the IDF would redeploy—not fully withdraw—while the cease-fire could be extended beyond 60 days only by mutual agreement.

#### Context

A temporary, U.S.-mediated truce in an asymmetric conflict echoes the 2011 Gilad Shalit exchange (1 soldier for 1,027 prisoners) and the 1983 Lebanon armistice where cease-fires masked unresolved power asymmetries; both collapsed into further violence within years. The Witkoff draft reflects a century-long pattern: outside powers tie humanitarian relief to political deals, from the 1919 Hoover food program in post-WWI Europe to 1990s Iraq oil-for-food. Here, food scarcity and hostage angst are the levers. Acceptance by Israel but not Hamas underscores a structural trend since Oslo—Israeli governments trade tactical pauses for incremental gains while armed Palestinian factions demand irreversible political ends. On a 100-year arc, whether this moment matters depends on if it breaks that cycle; if the plan stalls, it will join the litany of short-lived truces that neither solved security dilemmas nor rebuilt governance, merely buying time as demographic, ideological and regional pressures—especially Iran’s backing of proxies and waning Western patience—continue to reshape the conflict landscape.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media (Fox News, The Jerusalem Post)**: Present the Witkoff–Trump cease-fire proposal as a constructive Israeli step while warning that Hamas will likely reject it and stressing that Gaza’s humanitarian crisis is the militant group’s fault, not Israel’s. Consistently minimises Palestinian civilian suffering, echoes Israeli government talking-points and casts UN agencies as unreliable, reflecting ideological incentives to defend a close U.S. ally and appeal to pro-Israel audiences.

- **Left leaning media (The Guardian, BBC, The New York Times)**: Frame Israel’s renewed bombardment and blockade as causing mass starvation and civilian deaths, arguing that the new U.S.–Israeli cease-fire offer would prolong ‘killing and famine’ because it lacks guarantees to end the war or withdraw troops. Leans into casualty figures and genocide warnings supplied by Hamas-run or UN sources, foregrounding Israeli culpability while giving less scrutiny to Hamas tactics or rejectionism, which aligns with progressive audiences’ humanitarian focus.

- **International wire service (Reuters)**: Reports tersely that Israel approved the latest U.S. cease-fire draft before it was sent to Hamas and notes that Hamas has not yet responded, without ascribing motives or moral judgement. Pursues an appearance of strict neutrality, but this dependency on official briefings can sideline context about civilian conditions or power asymmetries, subtly privileging governmental narratives.
