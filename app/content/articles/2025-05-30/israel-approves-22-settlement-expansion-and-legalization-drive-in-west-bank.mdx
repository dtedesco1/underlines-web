# Israel Approves 22-Settlement Expansion and Legalization Drive in West Bank

On 29 May 2025 Israel’s security cabinet okayed 22 new Jewish communities—including outposts long deemed illegal—marking the largest single settlement push since the 1993 Oslo accords.

#### Focusing Facts

- Plan revives the evacuated Homesh and Sa-Nur sites and converts 12 wildcat outposts, while adding nine entirely new settlements and reclassifying one neighborhood as standalone, per Defense Ministry release.

- Peace Now notes the decision follows the July 2024 seizure of 12.7 km² in the Jordan Valley and comes after 10,503 housing units were advanced in just the first 11 weeks of 2025.

- Britain, France and Canada warned on 9 May 2025 they may impose targeted sanctions if further West Bank expansion proceeded.

#### Context

Jerusalem’s 2025 move echoes the 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights—another step that began with ‘temporary’ military rule before lawmakers quietly transferred civilian authority.  Like Menachem Begin’s 1977–79 settlement surge after the Sinai peace talks, today’s far-right coalition is exploiting global distraction (this time Gaza) to lock in facts on the ground and unwind the two-state architecture birthed by Oslo.  Structurally, it reflects a half-century trend: civilianising military occupation, legalising outposts ex post facto, and threading settlements along strategic corridors (Route 443 now, Highway 60 in the 1990s) to fragment contiguous Palestinian space.  On a century horizon, each such move nudges the conflict from a negotiable border dispute toward a one-state reality with unequal citizenship—testing both the durability of post-1945 international law prohibiting acquisition of territory by force and the willingness of allied democracies to enforce it.  Whether sanctions materialise or not, the precedent further normalises annexation as policy, much as repeated League of Nations failures in the 1930s emboldened later territorial revisionism.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli pro-government media (e.g., The Times of Israel)**: Portrays the 22 new West Bank settlements as a “historic” strategic move that strengthens Israel’s hold on its ancestral land and blocks a dangerous Palestinian state. Echoes government talking points, foregrounds security and biblical rights while giving little space to the international consensus that the settlements are illegal or to Palestinian perspectives. ([The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/defense-ministry-confirms-government-approval-of-22-new-west-bank-settlements/))

- **Left-leaning Western media (e.g., The Guardian, BBC)**: Frames the decision as the biggest expansion in decades that violates international law and further sabotages prospects for a Palestinian state. Uses charged descriptors such as “far-right” and focuses on illegality and annexation, giving limited weight to Israeli security arguments or domestic political context that favours settlement growth. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/29/israel-new-settlements-occupied-west-bank-palestinian-state), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1j5954edlno))

- **Arab and Muslim-world media (e.g., Al Jazeera)**: Depicts the settlements as an illegal annexation that ‘fuels fears of erasure’ of Palestinian land and warns it will ‘strangle’ Palestinian communities and doom any two-state solution. Strongly aligns with Palestinian narratives, employs emotive language and rarely acknowledges Israeli legal or security claims, which can sharpen perceptions of Israeli malice and downplay intra-Palestinian issues.
