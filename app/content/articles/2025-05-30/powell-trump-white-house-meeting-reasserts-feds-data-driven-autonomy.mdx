# Powell-Trump White House Meeting Reasserts Fed’s Data-Driven Autonomy

On 29 May 2025 Jerome Powell met President Trump at the White House—Trump pressed for lower rates, Powell replied that future policy would rely solely on incoming data and remain apolitical.

#### Focusing Facts

- Meeting occurred 29 May 2025 in the Oval Office, the first Powell-Trump sit-down of Trump’s second term.

- Powell reiterated that the FOMC will base decisions on “careful, objective, non-political analysis”; he disclosed no rate outlook.

- White House press secretary said Trump told Powell it is a “mistake” not to cut the fed-funds rate, currently 4.25%-4.50% after the May FOMC hold.

#### Context

Presidential arm-twisting of the Fed is hardly novel: LBJ hauled Chair William McChesney Martin to his Texas ranch in 1965, and Nixon brow-beat Arthur Burns in 1971-72—pressures that helped unleash the Great Inflation.  Today’s encounter fits that long arc of executive impatience with independent money managers, yet it also highlights post-1978 reforms (Humphrey-Hawkins, 1978; Supreme Court’s 2025 opinion limiting presidential removal power) that have progressively insulated the Federal Reserve.  Financial markets now read such meetings less as a policy signal than as a stress-test of institutional credibility; if the Fed bends, the dollar’s reserve status could erode over decades, but each public reaffirmation of independence—like Powell’s on Thursday—strengthens the norm.  Whether this moment is a footnote or a hinge depends on the cumulative effect of repeated political salvos: sustained pressure, coupled with ballooning deficits and tariff-driven price shocks, could eventually force a politically compliant Fed, repeating the 1970s playbook.  For now, the episode is another skirmish in a century-long tug-of-war between short-term electoral aims and the long game of price stability.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Financial news outlets (e.g., Yahoo Finance, CNBC, Bloomberg)**: The meeting underscores the Fed’s independence, with Powell stressing that any rate moves will be data-driven and insulated from politics despite Trump’s pressure. Because these outlets cater to investors and depend on Fed guidance, they largely stick to the central bank’s narrative and play down broader political ramifications that might unsettle markets.

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The New York Times, NBC News)**: Trump’s sit-down with Powell is the latest episode in his long, aggressive effort to browbeat the Fed while his tariffs and other policies already threaten growth and complicate monetary policy. A consistently adversarial stance toward Trump leads these outlets to highlight legal setbacks and economic risks tied to his policies, perhaps overstating their impact while casting the Fed chiefly as a victim of presidential bullying.

- **Right leaning media (e.g., Fox Business)**: Powell should heed Trump’s call to slash rates now that the president has ‘crushed’ inflation, because high borrowing costs are needlessly hurting housing and growth. By echoing the White House’s arguments and downplaying concerns about inflation or Fed independence, this coverage positions Powell as an impediment to Trump’s economic success.
