# Curiosity Rover Unearths Siderite, Plugging the ‘Missing Carbon’ Gap on Mars

NASA’s Curiosity rover has, for the first time, drilled rocks (2022‑23) that contain abundant siderite—5‑10 wt %—proving Mars once ran a full carbon cycle and thereby explaining how the planet stayed warm enough for liquid water before it dried out.

#### Focusing Facts

- Peer‑reviewed results appeared 18 April 2025 in Science, based on four drill holes along an 89‑m traverse on Mount Sharp inside Gale Crater.

- Magnesium‑sulfate‑rich salts were shown to mask siderite’s spectral signal, clarifying why previous orbital surveys failed to spot the carbonate.

- If similar sulfate layers planet‑wide hold comparable siderite levels, they could sequester a significant fraction of the CO₂ once needed to give Mars ~1 bar of atmospheric pressure.

#### Context

The discovery echoes the 1976 Viking landers’ inconclusive life‑detection experiments and the 1996 ALH84001 ‘Martian meteorite’ carbonate debate, but this time the carbonate is in situ and stratigraphically dated to ≈3.6 Ga. It confirms a long‑suspected trend: small, iron‑rich planets without plate tectonics can lock away their greenhouse gases irreversibly, dooming surface habitability. Earth’s subduction‑volcano loop, established by at least the Archean (>3 Ga), keeps its thermostat set; Mars’ one‑way sequestration shut the system down. Over a 100‑year horizon the finding matters less for immediate technology than for framing comparative planetary climate: it gives scientists a natural laboratory for carbon‑capture permanence, a cautionary tale about atmospheric fragility, and a benchmark for interpreting any organics that the Mars Sample Return—if it finally flies—could ferry home in the 2030s.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Science and technology media outlets (e.g., Popular Science, Ars Technica, ScienceAlert)**: They frame the siderite discovery as a major but incremental scientific breakthrough that validates climate models and strongly suggests ancient Mars was habitable, yet still stop short of claiming proof of life. Because these outlets compete for readership within a crowded science‑news niche, their headlines and narratives may slightly amplify the novelty or certainty of the findings to keep audiences engaged, even though the underlying evidence remains preliminary. ([Popular Science](https://www.popsci.com/science/mars-carbon-past-life/), [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/rover-finds-hints-of-an-ancient-martian-carbon-cycle/))

- **NASA‑affiliated press releases (e.g., Jet Propulsion Laboratory)**: The discovery is presented as confirmation that Curiosity’s instruments are answering long‑standing questions about Mars’ lost atmosphere while responsibly highlighting future work needed to quantify the planet’s carbon budget. As the mission’s operator, NASA has a clear incentive to showcase the rover’s success and justify continued funding, so its language stresses program achievements and avoids dwelling on remaining uncertainties or competing interpretations.

- **Headline‑driven mainstream/tabloid outlets (e.g., The Mirror, Economic Times)**: They hype the siderite find as direct 'evidence of life' or a revelation that Mars was not just habitable but possibly ‘truly hospitable,’ leaning into dramatic language that promises a rewrite of what we know about the Red Planet. Pursuing clicks and broad audience appeal, these publications exaggerate the life‑discovery angle and downplay caveats voiced by scientists, which can oversimplify nuanced research and mislead casual readers.
