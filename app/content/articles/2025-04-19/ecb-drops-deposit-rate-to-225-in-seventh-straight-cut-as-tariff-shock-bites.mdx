# ECB Drops Deposit Rate to 2.25% in Seventh Straight Cut as Tariff Shock Bites

On 17 Apr 2025 the European Central Bank reduced its deposit facility rate by 25 bps—from 2.50 % to 2.25 %—explicitly citing U.S.–EU tariff uncertainty and cooling inflation.

#### Focusing Facts

- This is the ECB’s seventh quarter‑point cut since June 2024, bringing the cumulative reduction to 175 bps from the 4 % peak reached in mid‑2023.

- Eurozone headline inflation slid to 2.2 % in March 2025, while core inflation fell to 2.4 %, both edging toward the 2 % target.

- Washington’s general tariff on EU goods now stands at 10 % under a 90‑day pause, with sector‑specific levies of 25 % on autos, steel and aluminium still in force.

#### Context

Trade shocks have repeatedly forced the ECB into defensive easing—just as the 1930 Smoot‑Hawley tariffs pushed the Fed to slash its discount rate from 6 % to 3 % within a year—yet protectionism kept global demand weak. Today’s cut continues a pattern: after crisis‑era hikes in 2011 and the post‑Ukraine surge to 4 % in 2023, the Governing Council again pivots as soon as external demand evaporates, underscoring how Europe’s monetary stance is now hostage to geopolitical tariff cycles, not domestic overheating. Over the century‑long arc, the move hints at a fracturing of the post‑1995 hyper‑globalization regime: central banks must offset trade‑policy volatility rather than simply target inflation. If tariff escalation persists, the ECB risks repeating the 2014–2016 slide toward the zero lower bound, entrenching low neutral rates and eroding its policy space for the next shock.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Global financial news outlets (e.g., CNBC, Reuters, Investing.com)**: Frame the quarter‑point rate cut as the logical, market‑priced response to tariff‑fuelled uncertainty, with policymakers simply following fading inflation and investor expectations. Heavily quoting banks and market odds aligns coverage with trader sentiment, so stories can portray the move as inevitable and play down wider social or distributional effects.

- **European policy‑focused and regional media (e.g., EurActiv, RTE.ie, The Irish Times)**: Emphasise U.S. trade brinkmanship as the main danger, arguing the ECB must cut because tariffs and a strong euro are already denting growth and could soon force still deeper easing. Focusing on external shocks can shift responsibility away from eurozone structural issues and subtly encourage a solidarity‑oriented EU political stance.

- **Currency‑trading commentary sites (e.g., ForexLive, FXStreet)**: Treat the decision chiefly as a short‑term trading catalyst, noting that the euro’s brief dip after the cut faded because the move was fully priced in and technical levels held. With an audience of day‑traders they reduce complex policy choices to near‑term price action, potentially underplaying longer‑run economic stakes for households and firms.
