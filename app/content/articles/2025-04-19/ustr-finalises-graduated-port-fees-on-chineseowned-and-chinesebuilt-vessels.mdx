# USTR Finalises Graduated Port Fees on Chinese‑Owned and Chinese‑Built Vessels

On 18 Apr 2025, the Trump administration issued a Section 301 determination that from 14 Oct 2025 Chinese shipping lines will pay US$50 per net ton (rising to US$140 by 2028) per U.S. voyage, while any ship built in China will be charged at least US$18 per net ton or US$120 per container, capped at five voyages a year.

#### Focusing Facts

- Grace period: fees are set at US$0 for the first 180 days and begin accruing on 14 Oct 2025, according to the 42‑page Federal Register notice.

- A waiver erases the fee for up to three years if the owner orders and takes delivery of a U.S.-built ship of equal or larger tonnage.

- The investigation originated with a March 2024 petition by five U.S. labor unions and concluded that China builds nearly 50 % of the world’s commercial tonnage while the U.S. builds five or fewer large ships per year.

#### Context

Washington has not tried to tax foreign ships this directly since the 1817 Navigation Act that barred non‑U.S. vessels from domestic routes; like Britain’s 1651 Navigation Acts, the new fees aim to redirect freight to national shipyards but risk retaliation and higher consumer prices.  The measure sits at the confluence of three longer arcs: (1) the bipartisan turn toward industrial policy and ‘decoupling’ from China that accelerated after the 2018 trade war; (2) America’s half‑century decline in commercial shipbuilding—from post‑WWII dominance to 0.1 % of world output today; and (3) the resurrection of Section 301 as a catch‑all tool to pursue strategic objectives beyond tariffs.  Whether this moment matters in 2125 depends on capacity: if U.S. yards cannot deliver competitively priced vessels—much as the 1930 Smoot‑Hawley tariffs failed to revive U.S. agriculture—the fees may simply reroute cargo through third countries and entrench Asian shipyards.  If, however, it sparks sustained investment akin to Japan’s 1950s shipbuilding surge, it could mark the opening shot in a decades‑long re‑ordering of maritime supply chains.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **USTR and supportive business press (USTR.gov, CNBC, NDTV)**: The new port fees are portrayed as a strategic response to China’s unfair shipbuilding dominance that will revive U.S. shipyards and strengthen supply‑chain security. Coverage closely mirrors administration talking points and minimizes discussion of higher costs or practical hurdles, reflecting incentives to present the policy as an industrial success story.

- **Pro‑market and conservative editorial outlets (WSJ editorial via Raw Story, Financial Times, BBC)**: They depict the fees as another tax that will saddle U.S. businesses and consumers with higher costs while failing to make American shipbuilding ‘great again’. By foregrounding economic pain they downplay strategic trade goals, consistent with free‑trade and anti‑tariff leanings that oppose Trump’s protectionist measures.

- **Asian and shipping‑industry coverage (South China Morning Post, Splash247)**: Reports emphasise that the plan sharply raises the stakes in the Sino‑U.S. trade war and could saddle Chinese operators with hefty new charges far exceeding earlier proposals. Focusing on worst‑case fee calculations and Chinese reactions underscores a narrative of U.S. aggression and disruption that resonates with regional and industry audiences worried about trade flows.
