# Second U.S.–Iran Nuclear Negotiations Open in Rome as Israel Weighs Solo Strike

On 19 April 2025 Tehran and Washington resumed indirect, Omani‑mediated nuclear talks in Rome, agreeing to reconvene technical teams next week even as President Trump stalled Israeli plans for an imminent attack.

#### Focusing Facts

- Round two began 19 Apr 2025 at the Omani Embassy in Rome between envoy Steve Witkoff and FM Abbas Araghchi under Omani FM Badr al‑Busaidi’s mediation.

- The delegations scheduled a follow‑up expert meeting in Muscat for 26 Apr 2025 to draft technical parameters.

- NYT and Reuters report Trump on 18 Apr 2025 asked Israel to delay a spring strike plan, though Israeli officials still study a limited attack option.

#### Context

Great‑power brinkmanship wrapped in negotiation echoes the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when back‑channel talks and public saber‑rattling ran in tandem; similarly, diplomacy today is flanked by carrier groups, missile parades and Israeli contingency plans.  This episode spotlights two long‑running currents: the slow erosion of the 1968 Non‑Proliferation Treaty’s authority as regional powers hedge with enrichment capacity, and the growing use of middle states—Oman in 2013‑15 and again now—as neutral platforms amid U.S. retrenchment and Russian opportunism.  Whether the talks succeed or collapse, the interaction marks a test of transactional, deadline‑driven U.S. diplomacy versus Iran’s decades‑honed incrementalism; the outcome will signal to Riyadh, Ankara and others whether nuclear latency, not disarmament, is the workable 21st‑century norm.  On a century horizon, the episode matters because it will either reinforce or further fracture the post‑WWII non‑proliferation architecture; a breakdown followed by an Israeli or U.S. strike could normalize preventive war, while a verifiable cap could, like the 1975 Helsinki Accords, become a stabilizing—if imperfect—pillar for decades.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right‑leaning U.S. media (e.g., Fox News)**: Tehran’s long record of deception proves the regime cannot be trusted, so any deal must force Iran to eliminate enrichment entirely or face decisive U.S. military action. The coverage employs alarmist language about a 'rogue' Iran and lauds President Trump’s hard‑line stance, reflecting conservative ideological incentives and a hawkish policy preference.

- **Middle‑East regional outlets sympathetic to Iran’s position (e.g., Al Jazeera Online, Daily Sabah)**: Iran will engage in the talks despite serious doubts about U.S. intentions, insisting its enrichment and missile programs are sovereign red lines while seeking sanctions relief. Framing emphasizes U.S. unreliability and amplifies Iranian red‑lines, downplaying concerns over potential weaponization in line with regional political interests that counter Western narratives.
