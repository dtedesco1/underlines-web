# Trump Vows “100%” EU Trade Deal and Accepts Rome Summit During Meloni’s White‑House Tariff Talks

On 17 April 2025, after meeting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White House, President Donald Trump said a U.S.–EU trade agreement will be reached before the current 90‑day tariff pause expires and agreed to travel to Rome to pursue talks with wider European leaders.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump’s 9 April order froze a planned 20 % duty on EU goods, cutting it to 10 % for 90 days that end in mid‑July 2025.

- In the Oval Office Meloni secured Trump’s verbal acceptance of an official visit to Rome, aimed at convening EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and others.

- Italy currently spends 1.49 % of GDP on defence and told Trump it will reach NATO’s 2 % target, addressing a second U.S. demand.

#### Context

When a U.S. president publicly guarantees a trade pact, memories of the 1988 U.S.–Canada FTA signing weeks before an election—or the 1930 Smoot‑Hawley tariff spiral that began with ‘temporary’ duties—loom large. Trump’s tariff threats fit a century‑long pendulum from multilateralism (GATT 1947, WTO 1995) back toward transactional bilateralism. By casting a nationalist Meloni as interlocutor, Washington is exploiting ideological cleavages inside the EU much as Nixon courted de Gaulle‑era France in the late 1960s to weaken a unified European front. Whether the gambit yields a deal or merely buys time, it signals that the Atlantic alliance is now negotiated leader‑to‑leader, not institution‑to‑institution—a structural shift that, if it endures, could erode the post‑1945 rules‑based trade system over the next century. The moment matters because tariff escalations, once normalized, are hard to unwind and often metastasize into strategic realignments; yet it could also prove ephemeral theatre if Brussels ultimately dictates terms. The diverse sources—from establishment BBC to partisan Breitbart—spotlight how media ecosystems selectively frame the meeting as either pragmatic diplomacy or culture‑war camaraderie, reminding us to separate verifiable actions (tariff numbers, scheduled visits) from narrative spin about “saving Western civilisation.”

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left-leaning media**: The encounter shows Trump embracing a European leader with neo‑fascist roots while still clashing over tariffs and Ukraine, illustrating a worrying shift toward "western nationalism" that could strain the trans‑Atlantic order. By stressing fascist lineage and discord, outlets spotlight ideological alarms yet risk playing down economic diplomacy successes in order to frame the meeting as chiefly a threat to liberal norms. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/17/giorgia-meloni-trump-meeting), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/17/nx-s1-5366821/trump-italy-meloni))

- **Right-leaning media**: Meloni’s visit is hailed as a diplomatic master‑class confirming a "100 %" imminent trade deal and a joint crusade with Trump to "make the West great again" against woke ideology and mass migration. Cheerleading language magnifies personal chemistry and certainty of victory while glossing over unresolved tariff details and European skepticism. ([Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/04/17/italian-pm-meloni-to-trump-we-can-make-the-west-great-again/), [One America News Network](https://www.oann.com/newsroom/trump-promises-100-chance-of-trade-deal-with-eu-during-wh-meeting-with-italian-pm-giorgia-meloni/))

- **Public service/centrist broadcasters**: The meeting is presented as a cordial but mainly symbolic bid by Meloni to act as a bridge between the EU and a tariff‑wielding Trump, yielding no concrete concessions yet earning her influence as the "Trump whisperer." Focusing on personalities and process rather than hard outcomes can understate the economic stakes and human impact of looming tariffs. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjlr3mnlero))
