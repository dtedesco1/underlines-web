# Israel Carves Permanent Buffer Zones in Gaza After Netanyahu's On‑Site Visit as Hostage Talks Falter

On 14‑16 April 2025, Israel publicly moved to annex roughly half of Gaza into military ‘security zones’—a step underscored by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s surprise trip to northern Gaza—while simultaneously freezing all humanitarian aid and rejecting Hamas’s Cairo offer to release the remaining 58 hostages for a full cease‑fire.

#### Focusing Facts

- Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz confirmed a Rafah buffer of about 29 sq mi plus two north‑south military corridors, leaving 70 % of Gaza under evacuation or no‑go orders (UN, 16 Apr 2025).

- Hamas negotiator Taher al‑Nunu (15 Apr 2025) said the group would free all Israeli captives if Israel agreed to withdraw and end the war; Israel instead halted aid on 2 Mar 2025 and demanded release of 19 living hostages first.

- Al‑Ahli Hospital, the last major facility in northern Gaza, was struck again on 13 Apr 2025, destroying its genetic lab and forcing evacuation of 50 patients, WHO confirmed.

#### Context

Buffer zones meant to police militants are not new—Israel maintained a ‘security strip’ six‑miles deep inside south Lebanon from 1985 until its costly withdrawal in 2000—yet they often morph into creeping annexation.  Today’s carve‑up of Gaza mirrors that logic on a denser, urban canvas, accelerated by drone surveillance and precision artillery that allow a small army to police emptied land.  Hostage‑for‑aid diplomacy also echoes the Korean War (1953) when POW exchanges determined armistice timing.  Over a 100‑year horizon, the move signals a hard pivot away from any contiguous Palestinian polity: Gaza is being fragmented into quarantined enclaves whose viability depends on Israel’s gatekeeping.  Such demographic engineering, if locked in, could reshape the conflict from a dispute over borders to one over rights under indefinite occupation, a shift that has historically fuelled protracted insurgencies rather than extinguishing them.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli government officials and sympathetic outlets**: They argue that expanding buffer zones, blocking aid and continuing military operations are necessary pressure tools to force Hamas to free the remaining hostages and guarantee Israel’s security. This security‑first framing largely sidelines the 51,000‑plus Palestinian death toll and the worsening humanitarian crisis detailed elsewhere, minimising Israel’s responsibility for civilian suffering.

- **Hamas spokespeople and Palestinian‑aligned media**: They present Hamas as ready to release all Israeli captives in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal and accuse Israel of reneging on cease‑fire commitments to prolong the war. By casting Israel as the sole obstacle, they gloss over Hamas’s initial Oct 7 attack, ongoing rocket fire and use of hostages as bargaining chips, while casualty figures come from Hamas‑run bodies that cannot be independently verified.

- **Left‑leaning international and humanitarian‑focused media**: These outlets foreground the massive civilian toll, destruction of Gaza’s hospitals and the shrinking territory available to Palestinians, urging an immediate cease‑fire and condemning Israel’s actions as collective punishment. Their coverage relies heavily on Gaza health ministry statistics and Palestinian eyewitnesses, sometimes giving less space to Israel’s security rationale or to evidence of Hamas’s military activity around civilian sites.
