# Trump Threatens Sanctions and Tariffs to End Russia-Ukraine War

President Trump has publicly warned Russia of imposing taxes, tariffs, and sanctions if a peace agreement to end the Ukrainian war isn't reached soon.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump sent the warning via a Truth Social post on January 22, 2025.

- Russian exports to the US, primarily phosphate-based fertilizers and platinum, may be targeted by new sanctions.

- Ukraine requests 200,000 peacekeepers, with US troops, for any peace agreement.

#### Context

The dynamics of Trump's recent threats resemble Cold War diplomacy where economic leverage was a tool of political negotiation, albeit in a different context. The strategy reflects long-term tensions between Russia and the US that have been evolving since the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Trumpâ€™s policy push suggests a return to 'gunboat diplomacy', reminiscent of the 19th and early 20th centuries, but through economic rather than military means. Historically, economic sanctions have had varied impacts, such as their ambiguous effect on Iran's policies versus the calculated income loss for the US during trade tiffs with China. Over the long term, wielding economic threats could either force negotiation or harden opposition, with repercussions lasting decades as global power dynamics shift.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Lew Rockwell**: This group suggests that Trump's public attempts at negotiation with Russia are ineffective and out of sync with previous campaign promises of improved Russo-American relations, implying that he has been influenced by bureaucratic pressures. The portrayal of Trump's actions as ineffective and influenced by others aligns with a libertarian skepticism towards centralized power and established political processes, potentially downplaying complexities in international relations.

- **Right-leaning media**: This group presents Trump as assertively trying to leverage economic pressure on Putin to end the war, emphasizing his intention to end conflicts diplomatically and criticizing the past administration's handling of the situation. The depiction of Trump as a negotiator seeking pragmatic solutions may overlook the complexities and challenges of international diplomacy, highlighting a preference for strong leadership and direct action.

- **Left-leaning media**: This group criticizes Trump for blaming Zelensky for the war and suggests his attempts at negotiation are misguided, emphasizing the historical inaccuracies in his statements and previous Russian aggression. The focus on Trump's blame-shifting and historical inaccuracies points to a critique of his diplomatic approach and potential undermining of Ukrainian agency, reflecting concerns about his leadership style and factual accuracy.
