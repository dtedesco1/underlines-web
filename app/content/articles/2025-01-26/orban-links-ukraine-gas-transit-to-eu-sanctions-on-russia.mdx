# Orban Links Ukraine Gas Transit to EU Sanctions on Russia

Hungary is blocking the renewal of EU sanctions on Russia unless Ukraine reopens Russian gas transit routes, disrupting the EU's sanctions agenda.

#### Focusing Facts

- Sanctions against Russia will lapse on January 31 without unanimous EU approval.

- Hungary demands Ukraine restore gas transit and cease pipeline attacks to agree on sanction renewal.

- 80% of Hungary’s gas is sourced from Russia.

#### Context

Orban's demand ties into Hungary's long-standing dependency on Russian gas, an echo of Eastern European reliance on Soviet energy during the Cold War. The insistence on reopening Ukraine's gas routes while tying it to sanctions echoes past transactional diplomacy, reminiscent of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's secret energy agreements in 1939. Currently, Hungary’s assertive stance highlights the challenges facing EU's cohesive policy amidst national interests. The event underlines the ongoing geopolitical struggle around energy dependency, a pivotal concern in Europe since the 1973 oil crisis. In the long span of history, these dynamics may signify recurring energy politics challenging unified EU foreign policy efforts.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: Viktor Orban's opposition to extend EU sanctions against Russia is portrayed as a pragmatic stance to protect Hungary's economy, particularly concerning the pipeline and energy security issues with Ukraine. This perspective tends to emphasize Orban's actions as economically rational, potentially downplaying the geopolitical implications and Orban's relationship with Putin.

- **European independent media**: Orban's threat to block EU sanctions against Russia is depicted as a significant challenge to the EU's unified stance on Russia, highlighting the political and economic pressures within the EU. This perspective may exaggerate Orban's influence or overstate the EU's instability, potentially for dramatic effect to capture reader interest.

- **Ukrainian media**: The Ukrainian media suggests that Orban's demands for Ukraine to reopen gas transit is undermining Ukraine's efforts to distance from Russian energy and exaggerate the economic impact on Hungary. This view might downplay the economic impacts on Hungary because of a priority to emphasize national unity and energy independence from Russia.
