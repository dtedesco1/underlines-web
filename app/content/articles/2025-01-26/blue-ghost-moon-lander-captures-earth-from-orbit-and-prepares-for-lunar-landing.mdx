# Blue Ghost Moon Lander Captures Earth from Orbit and Prepares for Lunar Landing

Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost moon lander successfully captures Earth imagery and conducts precise engine burns as it prepares for lunar landing on March 2, 2025.

#### Focusing Facts

- Blue Ghost's first critical engine burn adjusted its apogee using Spectre RCS thrusters on January 24, 2025.

- The Blue Ghost lander is part of NASA's CLPS program, carrying 10 NASA science experiments to the moon.

- Blue Ghost launched on January 15, 2025, with an expected lunar landing on March 2, 2025.

#### Context

The successful launch and operation of Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander represents a significant advancement in commercial lunar exploration efforts, echoing the Apollo missions' ambitious goals but within a framework shifted towards public-private partnerships. Historically, the push towards lunar exploration was epitomized by the Apollo program of the 1960s, marking its zenith with the 1969 moon landing as a demonstration of geopolitical prowess during the Cold War era. Today, however, the Blue Ghost mission reflects a modern trend: leveraging commercial innovation to reduce costs and expand scientific capabilities in space exploration. This approach not only reflects NASA's broader Artemis program goals but also the increasing international and corporate competition in space, as seen with missions from China, India, and other private enterprises. On a century timescale, these collaborations could redefine humanity's reach into the cosmos, potentially establishing bases on the moon and beyond, fundamentally altering our presence in the solar system.
