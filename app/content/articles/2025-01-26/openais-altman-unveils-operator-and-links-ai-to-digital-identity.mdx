# OpenAI's Altman Unveils Operator and Links AI to Digital Identity

Sam Altman released an autonomous web AI named Operator and projects linking user digital identities to AI actions through World, amidst controversies over biometric data.

#### Focusing Facts

- OpenAI's Operator partnered with Uber, Instacart, and DoorDash to integrate AI agent capabilities on their platforms.

- World by Tools for Humanity pivots to 'proof of human' web3 verification by scanning eyeballs, distancing from previous crypto focus.

- IDC projects $337 billion in AI investment in 2025, with 67% allocated to enterprise AI embedding.

#### Context

Historically, technological advancements like the introduction of ATMs in the 1960s initially displaced roles but eventually created new opportunities and efficiencies. The linkage of AI agents to digital identities represents a shift potentially redefining identity verification systems, reminiscent of the social security number system in the 1930s. However, as these digital shifts progress, issues of privacy and control akin to the early internet era debates over anonymity come to the forefront. On a long timescale, integrating AI with digital identification may lay the groundwork for a digitally augmented society, but it also risks exacerbating disparities and entrenching control within a powerful few. This moment matters as it reshapes the foundational concepts of identity and technology interaction, possibly steering societal norms and legal frameworks over the next century.
