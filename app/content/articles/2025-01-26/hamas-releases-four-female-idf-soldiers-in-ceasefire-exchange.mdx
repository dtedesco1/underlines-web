# Hamas Releases Four Female IDF Soldiers in Ceasefire Exchange

Hamas has released four Israeli female soldiers as part of a ceasefire agreement with Israel, exchanging them for the freedom of 200 Palestinian prisoners.

#### Focusing Facts

- Four IDF soldiers, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy, and Liri Albag, were held for 475 days by Hamas.

- Israel will release 200 Palestinian prisoners, including 120 with life sentences, as part of the exchange.

- The Gaza ceasefire was brokered with mediation from the United States, Qatar, and Egypt.

#### Context

This exchange marks the latest chapter in a fraught history of hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas, reminiscent of the 2011 Gilad Shalit prisoner swap where Israel released 1,027 Palestinian prisoners for one Israeli soldier. The ceasefire reflects longstanding cyclical negotiations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where periods of intense violence are followed by mediated pauses and exchanges. On a longer timescale, these actions highlight recurring struggles related to occupation, resistance, and international diplomacy. While momentous in immediate humanitarian terms, the lasting impact depends on whether it leads to more sustained peace efforts or simply a pause before further conflict.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: The focus is on the positive step forward in the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, highlighting the release of four female Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. They emphasize Hamas's potential violations of the deal, framing Hamas as unreliable and possibly undermining the agreement.

- **Palestinian-focused media**: Israel's ceasefire agreement with Hamas is criticized for not genuinely addressing the plight of Palestinians, focusing on ongoing arrests and detentions in the West Bank despite the ceasefire. The narrative may portray Israel in a solely negative light, emphasizing Israel's occupation and alleged violations while possibly downplaying complexities of the ceasefire.

- **International media**: Reports highlight the ceasefire agreement as a complex negotiation involving prisoner exchanges between Israel and Hamas, but also touch on the potential fragility and humanitarian implications of the deal. Coverage might tend toward neutrality but often notes humanitarian aspects, possibly portraying the agreement as diplomatically precarious yet necessary for peace.
