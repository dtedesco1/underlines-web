# Trump Administration Freezes Nearly All U.S. Foreign Aid Except to Israel and Egypt

Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a directive halting almost all U.S. foreign aid for 90 days, with exceptions for military funding to Israel and Egypt, effective immediately.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump's executive order and Rubio's directive affect all foreign aid, including Ukraine's assistance, pending an 85-day review period.

- Exceptions for Israel and Egypt were made for foreign military financing, with Israel receiving $3.3 billion and Egypt $1.3 billion annually.

- The order allows emergency food assistance to continue amidst the aid freeze.

#### Context

This sweeping freeze on foreign aid by the Trump administration echoes historical moments like the U.S. aid suspensions during the Carter administration in 1977, which prioritized human rights concerns over geopolitical strategy. By withholding foreign aid, the Trump administration is signaling a return to a more isolationist approach, reversing decades of U.S. foreign policy that used aid as a diplomatic tool. Historically, foreign aid has served as a means to project power and influence globally while promoting stability in regions of interest. The decision might have substantial implications for global stability and U.S. influence, as countries historically dependent on U.S. aid might turn to other global superpowers like China or Russia, disrupting geopolitical dynamics. On a century-long timescale, withholding foreign aid, especially in geopolitical hotspots like Ukraine, could contribute to a destabilizing power shift, thereby altering alliances and potentially global power balances.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: The U.S. halt on foreign aid, excluding Israel and Egypt, is seen as a reckless decision by Trump’s administration, prioritizing political motives over humanitarian needs and potentially destabilizing global aid systems, with significant life-or-death consequences. Left leaning media may emphasize the humanitarian impact and chaos of the decision while criticizing Trump's foreign aid policy, potentially downplaying any arguments about aid efficiency or political strategy.

- **Right leaning media**: The Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid is a necessary step to reassess and ensure aid aligns with America’s interests, ending an unchecked flow of money to countries like Ukraine, aligned with past criticism of foreign assistance spending under previous administrations. Right leaning media may frame the aid freeze as a triumph for American interests, ignoring potential negative global impacts and focusing instead on critique of past foreign aid policies by opponents.

- **Centrist media**: The U.S. foreign aid freeze is a significant policy shift, raising concerns about global stability and humanitarian impacts, but aligns with Trump's broader foreign policy goals of reviewing and reprioritizing foreign aid spending. Centrist media may aim to provide a balanced view but could underrepresent nuanced arguments from both sides, focusing instead on factual reporting without deep analysis of underlying motives.
