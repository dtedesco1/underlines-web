# Trump Demands OPEC Lower Oil Prices to End Ukraine War

In a speech at the World Economic Forum, Trump announced he would urge OPEC to lower oil prices, aiming to leverage energy costs to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

#### Focusing Facts

- Crude oil prices dropped 1% following Trump's comments.

- Trump enlisted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a potential $1 trillion US investment.

- Trump proposed slashing US corporate taxes from 21% to 15% while threatening global tariffs.

#### Context

Trump's call for OPEC to lower oil prices to impact geopolitics marks a recurring theme in interlinking energy markets with international diplomacy, reminiscent of the 1985 Reagan administration's diplomatic moves to counter Soviet influence by leveraging Saudi oil collaboration to drop crude prices. By advocating for energy-driven solutions to geopolitical issues, Trump revives historical tactics but within a distinct era where climate considerations and global interdependencies present formidable constraints. This moment reflects a larger trend towards economic nationalization and realpolitik, reminiscent of early 20th-century power plays, but with complexities heightened by today's entrenched trade networks and environmental urgencies. Viewed on a centennial scale, the long-term impact of prioritizing economic leverage over collaborative diplomacy remains debatable, as it risks igniting economic nationalism that could exacerbate global division while overlooking multifaceted issues such as climate change impacts.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **British media**: British media outlets are skeptical of Trump's assertive stance in using oil prices as leverage to end conflicts, especially with his pressure on Saudi Arabia and OPEC, and express doubts about the plausibility of this strategy. The skepticism could be driven by an underlying bias due to past strained UK-US relations during Trump's first term, compelling British media to critically analyze his policies.

- **Middle Eastern media**: Middle Eastern media like Al Jazeera highlight the potential destabilizing consequences of Trumpâ€™s foreign policy moves, especially on OPEC countries and longstanding alliances. Given Trump's controversial decisions affecting several Middle Eastern countries during his previous term, the regional media might have an inherent bias to perceive his strategies as overly aggressive or destabilizing.

- **American right-leaning media**: American right-leaning media portrays Trump's economic strategies as necessary bold measures to boost American industry and correct perceived imbalances in international trade. This perspective might gloss over the potential economic repercussions and criticisms due to alignment with Trump's political ideology and objectives.
