# Trump’s Gaza Blueprint Endorsed: US-Israel Plan for Forced Palestinian Displacement

On February 16, 2025, Israeli PM Netanyahu and US Secretary Rubio aligned with President Trump’s controversial proposal to expel over 2 million Palestinians from Gaza as part of a broader strategy targeting Hamas and Iran, linked to hostage negotiations amid a precarious ceasefire.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump’s plan involves US ownership and redevelopment of Gaza following the forced removal of more than 2 million Palestinians.

- A shipment of 2,000-pound MK-84 munitions arrived in Ashdod after the plan’s endorsement, reversing a previous ban.

- Netanyahu warned that if all hostages are not returned, 'the gates of hell' in Gaza will be opened, escalating military operations.

#### Context

This development builds on 15 months of intense conflict in Gaza and echoes historical episodes of forced displacement, reminiscent of Cold War-era brinkmanship such as the Berlin Crisis of 1961. By endorsing a strategy based on coercion — not negotiation — US and Israeli leaders signal a radical departure from previous attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Over the long term, this approach could reshape regional dynamics and international law norms, marking a sharp pivot towards hardline realpolitik that might influence Middle Eastern geopolitics for a century, much as past aggressive policies left enduring legacies.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: They portray Trump’s Gaza proposal as a bold and necessary strategy to safeguard Israel by eliminating Hamas and reinforcing US-Israel security cooperation. This perspective may downplay the humanitarian and legal repercussions of forced displacement, favoring strong military and political responses typical of conservative viewpoints.

- **International/Diplomatic Critiques**: They interpret Trump’s Gaza plan as a dangerous move that could amount to ethnic cleansing and destabilize the already volatile regional balance. This view might lean towards emphasizing human rights and international legal norms, potentially underrepresenting Israel’s security concerns and strategic calculations.
