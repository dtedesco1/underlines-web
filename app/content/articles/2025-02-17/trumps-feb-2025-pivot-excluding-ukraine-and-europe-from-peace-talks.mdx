# Trump’s Feb 2025 Pivot: Excluding Ukraine and Europe from Peace Talks

In February 2025, President Trump initiated contentious peace negotiations with Putin that sideline both Ukraine and Europe, altering longstanding US security commitments.

#### Focusing Facts

- On February 15, 2025, Trump and Putin discussed launching peace talks in Saudi Arabia, initiating a process that excluded Ukrainian direct input.

- Trump’s envoy Keith Kellogg explicitly stated that Europe would be consulted but ultimately left off the negotiation table, pressing European leaders to build an autonomous defense strategy.

- The U.S. Senate confirmed Tulsi Gabbard as director of National Intelligence amid moves seen as favoring Russian perspectives, further signaling a strategic recalibration.

#### Context

This event echoes the historic appeasement policies exemplified by Neville Chamberlain’s 1938 Munich agreement when concessions were made in hopes of lasting peace, only to embolden adversaries. In 2025, Trump’s approach—negotiating on terms that exclude key regional stakeholders such as Ukraine and Europe—reflects a broader realignment of U.S. priorities and an erosion of longstanding transatlantic security commitments since the Cold War. Over the past century, major global conflicts have often arisen from perceived US retrenchment or unilateral concessions, and this moment may herald a systematic shift in alliance architectures that will have significant repercussions on international stability for decades to come.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning revisionists**: This perspective argues that Trump’s pivot towards Russia is a corrective measure against decades of misguided NATO expansion and neoconservative policies that provoked Russian aggression. Advocates in this camp may downplay Russia’s aggressive actions and overly emphasize past Western mistakes to validate current pro-Trump policies.

- **European anti-appeasement critics**: This group condemns Trump’s concessions to Russia as a betrayal that undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and weakens NATO, warning that such policies embolden aggression. Their analysis may focus on the immediate risks and moral responsibilities towards Ukraine while sometimes overlooking strategic recalibrations intended by the US.

- **Ukrainian and European sovereignty advocates**: These sources stress that Ukraine must be fully involved in any peace negotiations and that European security should not be compromised by excluding regional stakeholders. This stance might overstate the unilateral rejection of any deal sidelining Ukraine, possibly neglecting broader diplomatic considerations and compromises.
