# Israeli Airstrikes on Iran Send Brent Crude Above $74 in Biggest One-Day Jump Since 2022

Israel’s 13 June 2025 strikes on Iranian territory instantly added a 5-9 % risk premium to global oil benchmarks and rattled equities on fears of Hormuz-linked supply shocks.

#### Focusing Facts

- At 00:29 GMT on 13 June, Brent spiked $4.02 to $73.38 a barrel—up 5.8 %—according to Reuters live pricing.

- Gold, a classic haven, climbed 1.2 % to roughly $3,427/oz, its highest level in nearly two months (FT/BBC data).

- Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.3 % in early trading, mirroring a broader 0.6 % opening drop in London’s FTSE 100.

#### Context

Flash oil shocks tied to Middle-East violence are hardly new: during the 1984-88 Iran–Iraq ‘Tanker War,’ attacks on Gulf shipping briefly cut exports by ~2 mb/d, and the 14 Sept 2019 drone strike on Saudi Aramco erased 5 % of world output for days. Today’s spike reprises that pattern but unfolds against two structural shifts: (1) the U.S. shale boom—production above 13 mb/d—has diluted Western reliance on Gulf barrels, while (2) China, now taking ~90 % of Iran’s exports, sits on a 1-billion-barrel strategic reserve that blunts immediate supply pain. Iran’s own dependence on Hormuz transit (and Beijing’s displeasure at triple-digit crude) limits the odds of a sustained closure, so the market is pricing risk rather than realized loss—hence a single-digit-percent move, not 1973’s quadrupling. Over a 100-year arc this event matters less for the price print than for what it signals: geopolitical chokepoints in a still-hydrocarbon world retain outsize leverage even as electrification and diversification advance; any prolonged Israel-Iran escalation would test whether that leverage can still coerce great-power intervention or whether distributed energy systems and strategic stocks have finally tamed the oil weapon.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Market-oriented financial media (e.g., Financial Times, CNBC’s markets desk)**: Israel’s strike marks a seismic escalation that will keep oil prices elevated, possibly above $100 a barrel, as traders brace for a prolonged supply shock across the Middle East. These outlets cater to investors and can profit from heightened trading volumes, so their headlines lean toward worst-case price spikes and may overstate the probability of a sustained disruption.

- **Risk-downplaying public broadcasters and analytical outlets (e.g., BBC business desk)**: While prices popped initially, analysts say the conflict could be defused quickly and Iran is unlikely to choke the Strait of Hormuz, so markets should re-price once the situation clarifies. By portraying themselves as sober explainers, they may underplay tail-risk scenarios to maintain audience trust and avoid fueling panic, relying heavily on expert sound bites that proved optimistic in earlier flare-ups.
