# Meta Stakes $14.3 B for 49% of Scale AI, Poaching Founder Alexandr Wang to Lead New “Superintelligence” Lab

On 13 June 2025 Meta closed a $14.3 billion minority investment for 49 % of Scale AI and simultaneously hired Scale’s 28-year-old founder Alexandr Wang to run a new in-house super­intelligence unit, marking Meta’s most expensive talent grab yet.

#### Focusing Facts

- Deal values Scale AI at roughly $29 billion, double its 2024 valuation.

- Scale’s chief strategy officer Jason Droege becomes CEO as Wang departs for Meta.

- Despite the 49 % equity, Meta receives no voting rights—an antitrust-minded structure mirroring Amazon-Anthropic and Microsoft-OpenAI tie-ups.

#### Context

Big-tech talent raids are not new—Google’s $500 M purchase of DeepMind in 2014 and Apple’s $3 B Beats buy in 2014 were similarly justified as ‘strategic’ but really revolved around securing founders Demis Hassabis or Jimmy Iovine.  The $14 B price tag shows how the 2022-25 generative-AI boom has inflated the cost of scarce senior AI leadership and data-engineering capacity, while regulatory pressure forces firms to take non-controlling stakes instead of outright acquisitions, a tactic pioneered by Microsoft’s successive non-voting investments in OpenAI (2019-23).  Over a century-scale, such moves signal a shift from hardware-led platforms (IBM mainframes 1960s, Intel PC chips 1990s, mobile OS 2007-15) to model-centric ecosystems where proprietary data pipelines—and the people who build them—are the choke points.  Whether Meta’s spend will matter depends on if Wang can deliver a step-change akin to Google’s 2017 Transformer paper; otherwise it could echo Japan’s costly Fifth-Generation project (1982-93), a historical reminder that pouring cash into moon-shot AI labs does not guarantee breakthrough or market dominance.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream financial press (Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, The New York Times)**: Portray Meta’s near-$15 billion stake in Scale AI as a calculated strategic partnership meant to turbo-charge the company’s lagging AI division and keep pace with rivals like Google and Microsoft. Relies heavily on company statements and deal metrics, so coverage tends to echo Meta’s corporate narrative of visionary growth while glossing over privacy concerns or the eye-watering price tag.

- **Tech and business commentary skeptics (Business Insider, The Verge)**: Cast the deal as a jaw-dropping $14-$15 billion “acquihire,” arguing Meta is essentially paying for 28-year-old Alexandr Wang’s talents because it is desperate to catch up in the AI race. Headlines spotlight sticker shock and talk-of-Silicon-Valley gossip, which can inflate the sense of corporate panic and underplay possible long-term synergies of the partnership.

- **Consumer tech press privacy watchdogs (TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Wired)**: Warn that Meta’s new AI products—especially the Meta AI app—are a privacy nightmare, with users unknowingly broadcasting sensitive medical, legal, and personal data to the public feed. Zeroes in on worst-case anecdotes and design missteps, reinforcing Meta-skeptic readership appetites and giving limited attention to Meta’s claim that sharing requires explicit opt-in steps.
