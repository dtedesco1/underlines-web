# China Launches First Human Trial of Coin-Sized Wireless Brain-Machine Implant

In June 2025 Chinese researchers publicly reported that a miniaturized, fully-wireless invasive BCI implanted in March in a quadruple-amputee produced reliable mind-controlled computer use, marking China as the world’s second country to reach clinical trials for such devices.

#### Focusing Facts

- After 2–3 weeks’ training, the March-implanted participant used only thought to play Chinese chess and racing games at a speed comparable to a laptop touchpad.

- The implant is 26 mm in diameter and less than 6 mm thick—roughly half Neuralink’s size—with electrodes whose cross-section is less than 20 % of Neuralink’s and 100× more flexible.

- The team (CAS CEBSIT & Huashan Hospital) plans a second clinical trial and aims to let the current subject control a mechanical arm next.

#### Context

Human BCIs have inched forward since the 1998 Brown University ‘Utah array’ study that let a locked-in patient move a cursor, yet most systems stayed in labs. Like the USSR’s 1957 Sputnik, this Chinese milestone signals a new front in techno-national competition: neurotechnology, not just AI. Over the past decade China has poured state funds into strategic ‘brain projects’, mirroring America’s BRAIN Initiative, and is now challenging U.S. dominance symbolized by Neuralink’s first human implant in 2024. The long trend is toward smaller, wireless, biocompatible interfaces that can function for years; if that arc continues, by 2125 BCIs could transition from disability aids to mainstream human–machine augmentation. Whether this single-patient success scales amid surgical, regulatory and ethical hurdles remains uncertain, but it underscores that the twenty-first-century space race may be taking place inside the skull rather than above the atmosphere.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Chinese state-run media outlets emphasizing national technological superiority (e.g., China Daily)**: Presents the invasive brain-machine interface trial as proof that China has caught up with and in key aspects even surpassed U.S. firm Neuralink, underscoring the miniaturized implant’s record-setting specs and the country’s rise to global leadership in BMI technology. By spotlighting speed, size comparisons, and quotes claiming China now holds a “leading position,” the coverage seeks to stoke national pride and soft-pedals unresolved regulatory, safety, and ethical hurdles that could temper the triumphalist narrative.

- **Chinese state-run global outreach platforms highlighting humanitarian benefits (e.g., CGTN)**: Frames the same BCI trial chiefly as a humanitarian breakthrough that will ‘improve the quality of life’ for amputees and spinal-cord-injury patients, stressing clinical collaboration and technical robustness rather than geopolitical rivalry. By foregrounding patient welfare and collaboration, the report markets China as a responsible scientific power aimed at global good, downplaying competitive rhetoric and omitting broader debates on data privacy or dual-use military applications.
