# Brazil Admits Vietnam as BRICS’ 10th Partner Country

On 14 June 2025, Brazil’s foreign ministry confirmed that Vietnam has been accepted as the tenth BRICS “partner country,” a new, non-voting status created in 2024 that lets Hanoi attend future BRICS summits and initiatives.

#### Focusing Facts

- Vietnam is the tenth state in the partner tier, joining Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda and Uzbekistan, according to Brazil’s 14 June 2025 communique.

- The partner-country category was established at the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia (22-24 Oct 2024), as a halfway house between observer and full membership.

- The first BRICS summit under Brazil’s 2025 presidency will take place in Rio de Janeiro on 6–7 July 2025, where Vietnam can participate but will have no voting rights.

#### Context

Geopolitically, this echoes the 1955 Bandung Conference and the 1961 birth of the Non-Aligned Movement—moments when emerging states tried to amplify their collective voice outside the dominant Cold-War blocs. Like the European Community’s phased enlargements (1973, 1986, 2004), BRICS is now layering entry—full member vs. partner—to widen influence without diluting internal cohesion. The move fits a decades-long trend toward ‘South-South’ institutionalisation and incremental de-dollarisation experiments; each new participant slightly increases the bloc’s market heft and bargaining power in forums such as the IMF, WTO and UN. Whether this matters in 2125 will hinge on BRICS’ ability to translate symbolic inclusivity into concrete policy instruments—common payment rails, pooled development finance—rather than becoming another G-77-style talk shop. Vietnam’s export-driven, US-allied yet non-aligned posture highlights how rising mid-powers are hedging, not choosing sides, in a slowly fragmenting global economic order.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Russian state media (TASS, RT)**: Vietnam’s admission is portrayed as further evidence that BRICS is building a more ‘inclusive and representative’ multipolar order that already outweighs the G7 and operates free from Western dictates. Coverage amplifies Moscow’s narrative of a rising bloc challenging US-led institutions, downplaying any internal frictions or the limited rights granted to mere “partner” countries.

- **Vietnamese state media (VietNamNet News, VietnamPlus)**: Reports stress that joining BRICS fits Hanoi’s long-standing policy of independence, multilateralism and responsible global citizenship, allowing Vietnam to raise the voice of developing nations and uphold a rules-based order. By highlighting Vietnam’s constructive role while avoiding any mention of BRICS’ anti-dollar rhetoric or geopolitical tensions, the coverage serves domestic diplomacy goals and sidesteps concerns about alienating Western partners.

- **Finance and crypto-focused outlets (The Daily Hodl)**: Vietnam’s entry is framed as another step in BRICS’ broader push for de-dollarization and even a gold-backed common currency that could bypass US financial dominance. The outlet accentuates sensational de-dollarization angles popular with its readership despite officials’ recent denials, reflecting a commercial incentive to spotlight narratives that attract crypto investors.
