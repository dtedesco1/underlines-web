# Israel’s Operation Rising Lion Flattens Natanz Enrichment Plant

In the predawn hours of 13-14 June 2025, Israeli warplanes bombed Iran’s Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan nuclear complexes, wiping out the above-ground Natanz enrichment hall and triggering an immediate Iranian missile response.

#### Focusing Facts

- IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi told the UN Security Council on 13 Jun 2025 that the Natanz above-ground enrichment facility had been “destroyed” by the Israeli strike.

- Iran’s UN envoy said the raids killed 78 people and injured over 320, calling them a “declaration of war.”

- An IAEA report released 11 Jun 2025 recorded Iran holding 408.6 kg of 60 % enriched uranium—sufficient for roughly nine warheads’ worth of fissile material.

#### Context

Preventive strikes on nascent nuclear programs have precedent: Israel hit Iraq’s Osirak reactor in 1981 and Syria’s Al-Kibar facility in 2007, each time gambling that short-term escalation was preferable to a future nuclear-armed adversary. Operation Rising Lion follows that playbook but in a far more complicated environment—multiple hardened sites, an Iran already at near-breakout, and big-power diplomacy under way. The raid underscores two long-term trends: the steady erosion of confidence in the global non-proliferation regime (the NPT and the JCPOA framework) and the growing willingness of regional powers to act unilaterally when they perceive existential threats. On a 100-year timeline, this moment could mark either the last gasp of the “nuclear monopoly” strategy—trying to bomb the genie back into the bottle—or the spark that accelerates a Middle-East nuclear cascade if Iran decides weaponization is now politically inevitable. Much as Sarajevo 1914 turned a localized act into a system-wide crisis, the danger is less the strike itself than the chain reaction it may set off in a region already saturated with mistrust and advanced missile technology.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media (e.g., Fox News)**: Presents Israel’s strikes as a legitimate act of self-defence that severely crippled facilities Iran was using to race toward a nuclear bomb. Relies heavily on Israeli military statements and ominous warnings about an imminent Iranian weapon while giving little scrutiny to civilian casualties or the legality of attacking nuclear sites.

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The Guardian, BBC)**: Argues that Netanyahu exaggerated Iran’s nuclear progress and may have struck to derail diplomacy or shore up his own political standing, noting U.S. and IAEA assessments that Iran is not actively building a bomb. Downplays weaponisation clues and leans on sceptical analysts, so readers may come away discounting real proliferation risks that intelligence agencies say they cannot fully verify.

- **Middle-East and progressive outlets critical of Israel (e.g., Al Jazeera Online)**: Frames the raid as a dangerous violation of international law that risks radioactive contamination and wider war, urging all sides to pursue diplomacy instead. Echoes Iranian claims about casualties and sovereignty infringements while largely ignoring Tehran’s past stonewalling of inspectors and enrichment beyond civilian levels.
