# Supreme Court Confronts Nationwide Injunctions in Trump Birthright-Citizenship Showdown

In an unscheduled 15 May 2025 oral argument, the Court took up the Trump administration’s emergency bid to strip lower courts of power to issue nationwide injunctions that are blocking his Executive Order ending birth-right citizenship for some U.S.–born children.

#### Focusing Facts

- Solicitor General D. John Sauer defended the administration before all nine justices in a consolidated case (Trump v. CASA, Washington & New Jersey) combining three district-court freezes issued in MD, MA and WA.

- The challenged Executive Order, signed 20 Jan 2025, has been ruled “blatantly unconstitutional” by every lower court so far, after lawsuits from 22 states and multiple immigrant-rights groups.

- Justice Clarence Thomas observed that universal injunctions were virtually unknown before 1963, questioning their historical legitimacy.

#### Context

Flashpoints over injunction scope recur whenever executive power meets nationwide policy shifts. The Court last weighed similar remedial limits during the New Deal: in 1935 Schechter Poultry v. U.S., it swatted down sweeping federal authority but did not bar injunctions beyond the parties. Today’s dispute echoes that remedial tug-of-war and invokes the 1898 Wong Kim Ark birthright ruling while revisiting tools popularized only in the civil-rights era (e.g., statewide desegregation orders of the 1960s). Whether the Court narrows universal injunctions will shape the long arc of separation-of-powers: a contraction would tilt power toward presidents and require challengers to litigate piecemeal, potentially slowing judicial checks just as administrative governance keeps expanding. Over a century horizon, this moment may mark either a retreat from the judiciary’s modern policing role or a reaffirmation that extraordinary remedies evolve with extraordinary governmental reach.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning media (e.g., Fox News, PJ Media)**: Portray liberal justices as overbearing while applauding conservative arguments that nationwide injunctions are historically unsound and hinder Trump from exercising legitimate executive power. Coverage highlights courtroom theatrics to rally conservative audiences, minimizes the strong lower-court consensus that Trump’s order is unconstitutional, and frames limits on injunctions as a blow against “progressive judicial activism.” ([Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-chief-justice-roberts-reins-sotomayor-after-repeated-interruptions), [PJ Media](https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/05/15/justice-thomas-destroys-case-for-nationwide-injunctions-with-one-devastating-question-n4939815))

- **Progressive media (e.g., Raw Story, HuffPost)**: Emphasize how Trump’s solicitor general was repeatedly dismantled by the justices, underscoring that the executive order is blatantly illegal and mocking conservative infighting when Barrett joins Kagan’s critique. Uses colorful language and social-media reactions to dramatize Sauer’s struggles and depict conservatives as flailing, largely presuming the order’s unconstitutionality and downplaying the possibility that the Court may still side with Trump on procedural grounds.

- **National public-service and wire outlets (e.g., NPR, AP)**: Focus on the broader institutional stakes, noting the justices’ skepticism of curbing nationwide injunctions, the long-standing constitutional protections for birthright citizenship, and the practical chaos that could follow a fragmented ruling. While aiming for straight reportage, the framing leans toward viewing nationwide injunctions as a necessary check on executive overreach and stresses the administration’s lack of substantive legal support, potentially mirroring center-left legal consensus.
