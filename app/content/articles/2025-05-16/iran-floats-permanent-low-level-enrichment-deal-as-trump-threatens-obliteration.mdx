# Iran Floats Permanent Low-Level Enrichment Deal as Trump Threatens “Obliteration”

On 14–15 May 2025, Tehran’s senior adviser Ali Shamkhani publicly offered to scrap all 60 % stockpiles, cap enrichment at civilian levels and sign immediately if Washington lifts sanctions, the first explicit Iranian acceptance of Trump’s core conditions.

#### Focusing Facts

- In an NBC interview aired 14 May 2025, Shamkhani answered “Yes” when asked if Iran would sign that day provided sanctions were removed.

- The fourth Muscat negotiating session on 11 May ran over three hours; U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and FM Abbas Araghchi agreed to convene technical teams for a fifth round.

- On 13 May, Senators Britt, Cotton and Graham filed a resolution demanding Iran’s “complete dismantlement,” signalling Congress may try to block any deal that allows enrichment.

#### Context

Tehran’s gambit echoes Libya’s 2003 agreement to ship out centrifuges in exchange for sanctions relief—an arrangement that briefly thawed relations before collapsing into civil war a decade later.  Structurally, the episode highlights three long-running arcs: (1) the 75-year struggle of the Non-Proliferation Treaty system to reconcile sovereign pride with inspection, (2) the 45-year U.S.–Iran cold conflict in which sanctions substitute for war, and (3) the emerging multipolar competition, with Russia dangling nuclear cooperation to spoil Washington’s leverage.  Whether this week’s offer matters in 2125 depends on two uncertainties: can a cash-strapped Iran accept permanent foreign monitors without losing face, and can an internally divided United States ratify any pact as administrations swing?  If either side fails, the region inches toward the 1960s South Asia trajectory—recurring crises culminating in overt weaponization—but a durable agreement could instead become the first multi-state enrichment consortium, a precedent that might update the aging non-proliferation architecture for the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: Portrays Trump’s threat of overwhelming force and sanctions as successfully bringing Tehran to the table, insisting any acceptable accord eliminates Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium altogether. Coverage lionizes Trump, labels Iranian concessions as capitulation, and downplays that the offer resembles the 2015 Obama deal, mirroring partisan incentives to showcase Republican strength.

- **Mainstream Western media**: Emphasises diplomatic progress, noting Iranian officials’ willingness to cap enrichment, ship out stockpiles and allow intrusive inspections in return for sanctions relief, with talk of creative regional consortiums. Reports tend to assume Iranian good faith and focus on negotiation details while giving less attention to hawkish U.S. and Israeli warnings that such limits could still mask weapons ambitions.

- **Global South media**: Frames Trump’s nuclear push as an obsession driven by geopolitical power plays and desire to curb Iran’s regional influence rather than purely non-proliferation concerns. Narrative stresses U.S. motives and regional destabilisation but offers little scrutiny of Iran’s past nuclear secrecy, reflecting a tendency to question Western intentions over Tehran’s record.
