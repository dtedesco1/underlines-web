# Trump Pressures Apple to Halt India Expansion, Cites Prospective Zero-Tariff Deal with Delhi

Speaking in Doha on 15 May 2025, President Donald Trump said he told Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop building new plants in India and instead increase U.S. output, claiming India has now offered the U.S. a trade pact with no tariffs.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump referenced Apple’s February 2025 pledge to invest $500 billion in U.S. facilities while asserting the firm would further “up” domestic production after their conversation.

- The remarks came during a 90-day pause on U.S. tariffs that expires 9 July 2025, during which India is negotiating to avoid the 26 % duties imposed in April.

- Apple currently assembles roughly 20 % of iPhones in India and has publicly targeted 25 % of global iPhone output from the country within “the next few years.”

#### Context

U.S. presidents have long tried to leverage marquee companies to advance trade goals—Ronald Reagan pressured Japanese automakers into ‘voluntary’ export restraints in 1981, and Barack Obama publicly urged GE to reshore jobs in 2012—but such jaw-boning rarely rewired global supply chains. Trump’s demand lands amid a broader 2017-25 trend of ‘friend-shoring’ away from China; Apple’s India pivot mirrors 1970s multinationals diversifying out of high-wage America, only in reverse. Yet the economics are stubborn: Wedbush estimates a U.S-made iPhone would triple in price, echoing how Smoot-Hawley (1930) tariffs backfired on domestic consumers. Whether India truly offered zero tariffs—or whether this is negotiating theater—matters less than the structural forces of cost, scale, and geopolitical risk that will keep production dispersed. On a century timeline, the episode is a blip in the ongoing tug-of-war between nationalist politics and transnational supply chains; history suggests headlines fade but the gravity of comparative advantage endures.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning US media (e.g., The Western Journal)**: Portray Trump’s demand that Apple stop building in India as a bold, America-first move that will shift jobs and investment back to the United States. Praises Trump’s stance while skirting the logistical and cost hurdles of U.S. iPhone production and presenting his unverified claims about Apple’s plans at face value, reflecting a pro-Trump incentive.

- **Left-leaning international media (e.g., The Guardian, BBC)**: Emphasise that Trump’s rebuke of Apple is unrealistic, noting experts who say U.S. assembly would be costly and highlighting the lack of detail on his tariff-free ‘deal’ with India. Focuses on impracticality and expert scepticism to underscore Trump’s protectionism as flawed, catering to audiences critical of his trade policy. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/15/trump-little-problem-tim-cook-apple-india-production-iphones), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq54ggd62w3o?xtor=AL-72-%255Bpartner%255D-%255Binforadio%255D-%255Bheadline%255D-%255Bnews%255D-%255Bbizdev%255D-%255Bisapi%255D))

- **Indian financial press (e.g., NDTV, Business Standard, MoneyControl)**: Report Trump’s remarks while stressing India’s ongoing negotiations, its growing role in Apple’s supply chain, and the absence of any official zero-tariff offer from Delhi. Frames the story to defend India’s manufacturing ambitions and question Trump’s narrative, potentially downplaying India’s high tariffs to reassure domestic readers and investors.
