# Trump Clinches $1.2 Trillion US-Qatar Pact Featuring Record Boeing Jet Order

On 14 May 2025 in Doha, President Donald Trump and Emir Sheikh Tamim sealed accords committing roughly $1.2 trillion in trade and defense cooperation, anchored by Qatar Airways’ unprecedented order for up to 210 Boeing wide-body jets.

#### Focusing Facts

- Qatar Airways’ deal totals $96 billion for 210 Boeing 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft—Boeing’s largest-ever widebody purchase.

- A defense package includes a $2 billion MQ-9B drone buy, a $1 billion Raytheon counter-drone system, and outlines $38 billion in potential joint security investments at Al Udeid Air Base.

- Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to make an official visit to Qatar, escorted into Doha by Qatari F-15s on 14 May 2025.

#### Context

Big-ticket Gulf arms-and-aircraft shopping sprees are not new—think of Jimmy Carter’s 1978 $2.4 billion F-15 sale to Saudi Arabia or George H.W. Bush’s 1991 post-Gulf-War arms packages—but the sticker price here eclipses even the 2017 $110 billion Saudi MOU Trump once touted. The event fits a century-long pattern of the U.S. trading security guarantees for petrodollar-backed purchases that sustain its industrial base; Boeing’s windfall echoes Cold-War-era “arsenal of democracy” logic while helping the firm recover from the 737 MAX crisis and pandemic slump. For Qatar, the massive spend hedges against regional isolation after the 2017 blockade and signals a pivot from soft-power sports diplomacy to hard-power procurement. On a 100-year horizon, such mega-deals may look like the late-imperial stage of a petro-economic order—lucrative yet vulnerable to energy transition, drone proliferation, and shifting great-power alignments—but for now they reinforce the enduring marriage between U.S. manufacturing clout and Gulf monarchies’ strategic anxieties.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning U.S. media (e.g., Fox News, Breitbart, One America News)**: Characterize Trump’s Qatar visit as a “historic” $1.2 trillion bonanza that proves his deal-making prowess and will create hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs. Echoes White House talking points uncritically, inflates figures beyond the signed $200 billion aircraft order, and omits questions about feasibility or Qatar’s human-rights record to cast Trump in the best possible light.

- **Mainstream international wire & public broadcasters (e.g., Reuters, BBC)**: Report that Qatar agreed to buy roughly 160–210 Boeing jets worth about $200 billion as part of wider economic talks during Trump’s visit, framing it primarily as a big commercial aviation transaction. By focusing on the narrower confirmed contract value and business context, these outlets may downplay the White House’s larger $1.2 trillion claim, appearing less enthusiastic about Trump’s role.
