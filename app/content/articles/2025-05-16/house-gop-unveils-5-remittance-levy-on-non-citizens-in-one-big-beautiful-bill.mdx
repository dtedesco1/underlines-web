# House GOP Unveils 5 % Remittance Levy on Non-Citizens in ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’

On 12 May 2025, U.S. House Republicans inserted a clause in their tax-extender package that would skim 5 % off every outbound money transfer made by anyone who is not a U.S. citizen.

#### Focusing Facts

- The provision would apply to roughly $32 billion in annual transfers from the U.S. to India alone, diverting about $1.7 billion a year into the U.S. Treasury at current volumes.

- Legislative calendar sets a House vote before Memorial Day (26 May 2025) and seeks presidential signature by 4 July 2025, enabling implementation as early as summer 2025.

- President Donald Trump, in his second term, publicly endorsed the measure and the broader bill that also makes the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent.

#### Context

Governments have periodically taxed or restricted private cross-border transfers when domestic politics trump open capital flows—Oklahoma’s 1 % fee on money-transfers (2011) and Trump’s aborted 2016 plan to fund a border wall via a Mexican remittance tax are recent echoes. This 5 % levy sits at the intersection of long-running U.S. debates over immigration, revenue, and capital mobility: a century-long trend that began with the 1913 Federal income tax and has oscillated between liberalisation (NAFTA, 1994) and nativist clamp-downs (Chinese Exclusion Act redux proposals, 2010s). If enacted, it nudges the U.S. toward a more mercantilist stance, signalling to diasporas that access to the dollar system is conditional. On a 100-year horizon, such moves, while small in fiscal terms, can reshape remittance-dependent economies and accelerate the search for alternative payment rails—much as high post-WWII capital controls spurred the Eurodollar market in the 1950s. The immediate dollars are minor; the precedent of taxing personal cross-border transfers from a reserve-currency issuer could matter far more to the architecture of global finance.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US Republican Party leadership and allied conservative voices**: The 5% remittance levy is a sensible way to finance extended Trump-era tax breaks and tougher border security while asking non-citizens to help foot the bill. Framing the tax as patriotic revenue overlooks its disproportionate hit on legal immigrant workers and repackages an anti-immigration agenda as fiscal prudence.

- **Indian diaspora-oriented news outlets and NRI community voices**: The proposal is an unfair ‘new form of stealing’ that will drain billions from NRIs, hurt Indian families and punish immigrants who already pay their share of U.S. taxes. Coverage centers almost exclusively on the financial pain to Indians, giving scant attention to U.S. domestic politics or broader fiscal trade-offs that motivate the bill.
