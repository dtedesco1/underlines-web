# Valve Debunks Rumored 89 Million-Account Steam Breach

After a dark-web vendor advertised a trove of 89 million “Steam” user records for US$5,000, Valve confirmed on 14–15 May 2025 that the leak was only expired SMS 2FA codes and that no Steam systems were compromised.

#### Focusing Facts

- Seller “Machine1337” listed a database claiming 89 million Steam records on 13 May 2025, priced at US$5,000, according to Underdark.ai.

- Valve’s statement on 15 May 2025 said the leaked data were limited to 15-minute one-time codes and phone numbers, with no passwords or account identifiers.

- BleepingComputer reviewed a 3,000-file sample and found only historic SMS passcodes, corroborating Valve’s assessment.

#### Context

The scare evokes the 77 million-user PlayStation Network hack of April 2011, yet here the core service remained untouched; only downstream SMS traffic was exposed. It highlights two enduring forces: the thriving secondary market for repackaged, often overstated data dumps, and the intrinsic frailty of SMS authentication, which transits myriad third-party carriers. As major platforms shift toward app-based or hardware keys, SMS scraps are becoming low-value but high-panic fodder. More telling is the information cascade: a single, thinly sourced LinkedIn post ricocheted through gaming media before facts were confirmed, showing that in cybersecurity the narrative layer can fail even when the technical layer does not. On a century scale this event is minor, yet it exemplifies how digital trust will hinge as much on verifying stories as on hardening servers.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Alarmed gaming and tech sites (e.g., XDA-Developers, VG247, PCGamesN, CNET, Game Rant)**: Report the 89 million–account dataset as a likely real breach that jeopardizes Steam users and urge everyone to change passwords immediately. Quickly amplifies a single LinkedIn post for clicks and urgency, speculating about vendors like Twilio before confirmation and benefiting from fear-driven traffic.

- **Follow-up games/tech press citing Valve’s denial (e.g., PC Gamer, Polygon, The Verge, Lowyat.NET)**: Echo Valve’s statement that only old SMS codes leaked via third-party channels, insisting Steam itself was never hacked and that users need not change anything. Relies heavily on Valve’s corporate assurance, potentially downplaying lingering unknowns to preserve access to the company and calm audience worries.

- **Skeptical how-to / consumer-advice outlets (e.g., The How-To Geek)**: Highlight inconsistencies and red flags in the original claim, concluding the breach story was false while still recommending standard security hygiene like 2FA. Positions itself as the rational fact-checker to build credibility, yet still leverages the incident to publish evergreen security-advice content.
