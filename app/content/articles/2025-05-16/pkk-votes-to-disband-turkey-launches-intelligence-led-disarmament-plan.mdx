# PKK Votes to Disband, Turkey Launches Intelligence-Led Disarmament Plan

On 12 May 2025 the Kurdistan Workers’ Party formally declared its self-dissolution after a 41-year insurgency, prompting Ankara to organise a Turkish-run, non-UN weapons hand-over in Türkiye, Iraq and Syria.

#### Focusing Facts

- Decision ratified at the PKK’s 12th congress held 5–7 May 2025 in northern Iraq and announced via Firat News on 12 May.

- Turkish officials insist disarmament will involve only Turkey, Iraq and Syria—“definitely no U.N. or third parties”—with MIT intelligence officers registering fighters and weapons.

- The conflict killed an estimated 40,000+ people since the PKK took up arms in 1984.

#### Context

Militant groups declaring an end to arms, from the IRA’s 1998 Good Friday turn to the FARC’s 2016 peace deal, show that congress votes rarely end violence unless backed by credible integration schemes and political openings. The PKK’s move reflects two systemic shifts: Turkey’s years-long extraterritorial pressure that pushed cadres into Iraq/Syria, and Ankara’s attempt to recast the “Kurdish question” from a military to a constitutional arena while tightening presidential control at home. Whether this moment becomes 2025’s Camp David or another aborted 2013-15 Turkish ceasefire depends on unresolved variables—KRG and SDF buy-in, prison amnesties, and intra-Kurdish rifts. Over a century horizon, a negotiated Kurdish status inside existing states would mark a departure from the post-Ottoman cycle of repression and revolt; failure could simply postpone the conflict until the next generation picks up new flags.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Pro-government Turkish media (Daily Sabah, News.az)**: Treat the PKK’s dissolution as a security triumph that validates Ankara’s “terror-free Türkiye” plan and warrants continued Turkish-led military presence in Iraq and Syria without outside mediation. Echoes AKP–MHP talking points, marginalising Kurdish political demands and attributing any push-back to rogue militants or foreign manipulators.

- **Western international media (Deutsche Welle, France 24)**: Cast the development as a potentially seismic but fragile shift, stressing unanswered questions about democracy, opposition crackdowns and Kurdish civil rights after the guns fall silent. Frequent focus on Erdoğan’s authoritarian tendencies may overshadow security dilemmas or intra-PKK dissent, reflecting a broader Western scepticism toward Ankara.

- **Kurdish-sympathetic or alternative outlets (Global Research, The National Interest)**: Emphasise the chance for expanded Kurdish democratic rights, prisoner releases and regional autonomy debates, portraying disarmament as a step toward broader reconciliation. Tends to underplay the PKK’s terrorist record and security risks, foregrounding Kurdish grievances and hopes in a way that can romanticise the movement.
