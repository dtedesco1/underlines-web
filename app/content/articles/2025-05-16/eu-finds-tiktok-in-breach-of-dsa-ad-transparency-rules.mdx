# EU Finds TikTok in Breach of DSA Ad-Transparency Rules

On 15 May 2025 the European Commission issued preliminary findings that TikTok’s advertising repository fails key Digital Services Act requirements, opening the door to fines of up to 6 % of global turnover.

#### Focusing Facts

- The probe began 19 Feb 2024 and is the first DSA proceeding concluded against TikTok.

- TikTok allegedly omits who paid for ads, which users were targeted, and does not provide a searchable ad library accessible to the public.

- A separate, still-open EU investigation is examining TikTok’s role in Romania’s annulled 2024 presidential election amid alleged Russian disinformation.

#### Context

Brussels’ warning echoes the EU’s 2018 antitrust push against Google’s shopping service—another case where regulators wielded market-wide rules to force big platforms into transparency, ultimately levying a €2.4 billion fine.  Long-term, the DSA represents Europe’s attempt to impose public-interest obligations on digital gatekeepers much as 19th-century trust-busting or 1934 US Communications Act constrained railroads and broadcasters.  If upheld, the decision tightens a regulatory ratchet: each high-profile enforcement (after X in 2024, now TikTok) normalises the idea that algorithmic advertising is subject to state oversight.  Whether fines bite or not, the precedent matters on a 100-year horizon because it shifts informational power—who sees what and why—from opaque private systems toward democratically accountable rule-sets, potentially reshaping how elections, commerce and culture are mediated online.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European policy-focused media (e.g., The Guardian, POLITICO, EurActiv)**: They frame the Commission's preliminary finding as evidence that TikTok is flouting EU consumer-protection and election-integrity rules and deserves tough penalties under the Digital Services Act. By foregrounding EU officials’ quotes and election-security worries, they echo Brussels’ enforcement agenda and may downplay TikTok’s due-process claims or similarities with other U.S. platforms. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/15/tiktok-breached-eu-advertising-transparency-laws-commission-says), [POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-says-tiktok-breached-dsa-ad-rules/))

- **Technology and e-commerce industry outlets (e.g., Engadget, PYMNTS.com)**: They report the charges but give prominent space to TikTok’s rebuttal that the rules are vague and enforcement should be ‘consistent’, casting the dispute as an interpretive debate rather than outright non-compliance. Because their audiences include platform operators and digital advertisers, they tend to highlight regulatory uncertainty and could understate the seriousness of the alleged consumer harms.

- **Financial market news outlets (e.g., Bloomberg Business, Investing.com)**: They treat the investigation chiefly as a material risk that could cost TikTok up to 6 % of global revenue, focusing on possible fines and the impact on ByteDance’s finances. This market-centric lens may reduce the issue to monetary downside for investors, giving little attention to societal questions about disinformation or child safety.
