# China Launches Shenzhou-20, Rotates Tiangong Crew and Debuts Upgraded Long March-2F

On 24 Apr 2025 at 17:17 Beijing time, China’s Shenzhou-20 blasted off to Tiangong, swapping in a new three-person crew for a six-month stint and marking the program’s 35th human-spaceflight.

#### Focusing Facts

- Launch: 24 Apr 2025, 17:17 CST (09:17 GMT) from Jiuquan on a Long March-2F/G rocket.

- Rocket carried 32 design upgrades, including first-ever 5 Mbps real-time telemetry instead of post-flight ‘black-box’ data recovery.

- Crew: veteran Chen Dong plus first-timers Chen Zhongrui and Wang Jie; Shenzhou-20 is China’s 5th crewed mission in Tiangong’s application phase.

#### Context

When the USSR sent Soyuz 11 to Salyut 1 in 1971 it signaled a shift from one-off flights to sustained orbital presence; Shenzhou-20 plays a similar role for China. Blocked from the ISS after the 2011 U.S. Wolf Amendment, Beijing followed a path reminiscent of France’s post-1960s Ariane program—turning exclusion into autonomous capability. Regular six-month rotations, incremental rocket upgrades and biological experiments show how human-in-orbit operations are becoming multi-polar and systematized, not symbolic stunts. Over the next century this flight will likely be viewed less as a headline event and more as another routine sortie that quietly built the industrial, biomedical and logistical base for permanent off-world habitation and a potential Sino-led lunar infrastructure; or, if cooperation supplants rivalry, as an early step toward a federated, multi-platform low-orbit economy.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Chinese state-owned media (Global Times)**: Describes Shenzhou-20 as a landmark success that showcases continuous technical upgrades and advances China’s "space dream" during the nation’s Space Day celebration. State-run outlet serves Beijing’s propaganda goals, stressing achievements while omitting any mention of military links, budget costs or international security worries.

- **Western mainstream media (Reuters, The Boston Globe, The Japan Times)**: Covers the launch as another step in China’s rapid space expansion, often noting its exclusion from the U.S-led ISS and portraying the effort within a broader great-power competition. Stories subtly foreground geopolitical rivalry and U.S. security concerns, which can over-accentuate a competitive lens while downplaying the purely scientific or cooperative aspects highlighted by Chinese sources.

- **Russian state-owned media (TASS)**: Reports the Shenzhou-20 launch in supportive, straightforward terms, highlighting the smooth crew rotation and timing on China’s Space Day without critical commentary. Coverage aligns with Moscow–Beijing strategic camaraderie, skirting any discussion of China’s military applications or Russia’s own space woes, thereby projecting an upbeat narrative about a key partner’s success.
