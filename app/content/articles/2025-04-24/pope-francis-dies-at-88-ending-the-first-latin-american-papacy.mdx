# Pope Francis Dies at 88, Ending the First Latin-American Papacy

At 7:35 a.m. on Easter Monday, 21 April 2025, Pope Francis died of bilateral pneumonia in his Casa Santa Marta residence, leaving the Holy See sede vacante for the first time in twelve years.

#### Focusing Facts

- Francis had been hospitalised for 38 consecutive days at Rome’s Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic (14 Feb – 23 Mar 2025) after a bronchitis flare-up evolved into double pneumonia.

- By February 2025 he had named roughly 80 % of the 129 cardinals eligible to elect his successor in the next conclave.

- In April 2024 he personally approved a revised Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis that trims papal funeral pomp—a rite now set to debut at his own burial.

#### Context

Modern Catholicism has not confronted the death of a sitting pope since John Paul II in 2005, but the dynamics now are closer to the “Year of Three Popes” in 1978—when rapid succession exposed ideological rifts—because Francis, like John Paul I, rewired expectations of the office through simplicity and decentralisation.  His passing caps a long arc in which the papacy migrated from a Euro-centric monarchy to a globalised, Latin-American voice; whether that shift endures will hinge on the electors he stacked, much as Pius XII’s 1958 cohort shaped Vatican II.  On a century scale, the moment matters less for any single doctrine than for cementing a trend: the institutional centre of the 1.4 billion-member church is drifting southward while internal culture wars—mirroring broader North–South and liberal–traditionalist tensions in world politics—intensify.  Future historians may read 2025 as the close of the “Francis Experiment,” testing whether moral authority can outpace clerical bureaucracy in an age of declining Western religiosity and rising Southern demographics.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Catholic Church media (e.g., Vatican News, outlets carrying official statements)**: Frames Francis primarily as a devoted shepherd whose life of humble service and love for the marginalized culminates in a simple, faith-focused passing and funeral. Institutional closeness encourages hagiographic tone, omitting the sexual-abuse crises and intra-church conflicts that marked his pontificate.

- **Mainstream Western media (e.g., Reuters, The New York Times, BBC, NBC, CNN)**: Presents Francis as a history-making reformer whose progressive push for openness and inclusion stirred intense resistance from conservatives and left unresolved controversies over abuse and governance. Commercial news values amplify drama by foregrounding divisions and scandals, sometimes underplaying the spiritual dimension cherished by practising Catholics.

- **International wire & regional outlets (e.g., AP via Yahoo, NDTV, CNN International)**: Highlights Francis’s global appeal and personal humility, noting both his concern for the poor and the criticism he drew from traditionalists but skimming the deeper policy disputes. Wire-service brevity favors broad human-interest angles and repetition of basic facts, providing less scrutiny of complex theological or political stakes.
