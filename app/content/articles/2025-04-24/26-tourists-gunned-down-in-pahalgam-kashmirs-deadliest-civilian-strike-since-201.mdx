# 26 Tourists Gunned Down in Pahalgam, Kashmir’s Deadliest Civilian Strike Since 2019

On 22 April 2025, militants opened fire on visitors in Pahalgam’s remote Baisaran meadow, killing 26 and forcing India’s leadership into an emergency security response.

#### Focusing Facts

- Twenty-six civilians—mostly out-of-state tourists—were fatally shot at the foot-accessible Baisaran Valley near Pahalgam on 22 Apr 2025.

- A Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy calling itself The Resistance Front claimed the assault hours after it ended, though Delhi has not yet issued formal attribution.

- Prime Minister Narendra Modi cut short a state trip to Saudi Arabia and ordered Home Minister Amit Shah to reach Srinagar for an on-site security review the next morning.

#### Context

Deliberately hitting holidaymakers recalls the 30 July 2000 Amarnath Yatra massacre in the same region, when 32 pilgrims were killed and tourism collapsed for years. The 2025 strike showcases two long-running dynamics: the post-FATF trend toward deniable ‘front’ outfits to shield Pakistan-based sponsors, and militants’ shift from well-guarded military convoys to economic soft targets just as Kashmir logged a record 2.1 million tourists in 2023. Across the seventy-seven-year India-Pakistan standoff, spectacular attacks—Pulwama 2019, Parliament 2001, Chittisinghpura 2000—have periodically reset diplomacy and military postures; each prompted either cross-border retaliation or tighter internal control. Over a 100-year arc this incident will matter less for its casualty count than for New Delhi’s policy choice: a Balakot-style reprisal could harden the conflict spiral inaugurated in 1947, while a rare blend of security and political outreach might finally undercut the utility of trans-LoC militancy. The event thus sits at the hinge between entrenched patterns and a potential strategic pivot.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian broadcast news and pro-government dailies (e.g., NDTV, The Times of India)**: They portray the Pahalgam shooting as a Pakistan-backed terror outrage and spotlight Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah’s vows that the gunmen will be hunted down and punished. By foregrounding government sound-bites and linking the assault to Lashkar-e-Taiba before an official confirmation, they bolster the centre’s tough-on-terror image while skirting discussion of security lapses or regional discontent. ([NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/videos/terrorists-target-tourists-in-pahalgam-pak-terror-crosses-red-line-929897), [The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-terror-attack-pahalgam-security-forces-terrorists-killed-tourist-injured-search-operation-police-pm-modi-hm-amit-shah-omar-abdullah/liveblog/120519770.cms))

- **International public broadcaster (BBC)**: Its dispatch focuses on the immediate human toll, stating a lower confirmed death count and quoting local officials without attributing the attack to any cross-border group. The cautious casualty figures and omission of the Pakistan angle reflect an editorial instinct to avoid amplifying unverified official claims, but may leave audiences unaware of militants’ stated affiliations highlighted by Indian outlets.

- **Indian national newspaper with centrist/liberal leanings (The Hindu)**: Its live blog stresses the still-uncertain death toll and records step-by-step government actions, quoting the Chief Minister’s remark that the strike is larger than recent civilian attacks. By emphasising unfolding facts and refraining from definitive blame, it projects sober reportage yet could be read as hedging on attributing responsibility or critiquing security preparedness to avoid appearing partisan.
