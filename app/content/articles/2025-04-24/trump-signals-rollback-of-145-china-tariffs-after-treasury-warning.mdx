# Trump Signals Rollback of 145% China Tariffs After Treasury Warning

On 22–23 Apr 2025 President Trump said the punitive 145 % duties on Chinese imports will be cut “substantially,” a shift prompted by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s private assertion that the current U.S.–China tariff standoff is economically unsustainable.

#### Focusing Facts

- At a closed-door JPMorgan investor summit in Washington on 22 Apr 2025, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects a “de-escalation” because “no one thinks the current status quo is sustainable,” according to multiple attendee accounts.

- Speaking in the Oval Office the same day, Trump stated the 145 % rate “won’t be that high… it will come down substantially,” while confirming formal negotiations with Beijing have not yet begun.

- U.S. equity markets rallied, with the S&P 500 jumping roughly 2.5 % after Bloomberg first reported Bessent’s remarks.

#### Context

Presidents have often used tariff threats as leverage before retreating once domestic costs mount—Herbert Hoover’s 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act prompted a 66 % drop in U.S. trade by 1934, and Richard Nixon’s 10 % import surcharge in 1971 was scrapped within four months. Trump’s climb-down echoes that pattern: sky-high duties rally political bases but collide with supply-chain realities and financial-market discipline. The episode highlights two long arcs: (1) the century-long oscillation between protectionism and liberalization in U.S. trade policy, and (2) the deep economic entanglement that makes a full U.S.–China “decoupling” costly despite geopolitical rivalry. Whether the eventual rate settles at 50 % or 10 %, the signal that even a tariff-first White House blinks when CEOs warn of empty shelves suggests that market feedback, not ideology, remains the governor on extreme policy swings—a dynamic likely to recur in future great-power economic skirmishes over the next hundred years.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The Guardian, The Daily Beast)**: Trump’s sudden pledge to slash the 145% China tariff signals he is back-pedalling under pressure from CEOs and plunging markets, underscoring the economic damage his trade war is already causing. Eager to showcase presidential incompetence, these outlets accentuate words like “terrified” and highlight worst-case economic scenarios, which can amplify perceptions of chaos beyond what the factual negotiations yet prove.

- **Business and financial press (e.g., Bloomberg Business, CNBC, Yahoo Finance)**: Reporting frames Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s private remarks about an ‘unsustainable’ tariff standoff as a signal that de-escalation is imminent, driving a relief rally on Wall Street. Because their core audience is investors, coverage focuses on market reactions and the economic upside of lower tariffs, giving comparatively little attention to broader geopolitical or labour-market consequences.

- **U.S. center-right political outlets (e.g., USA Today, The Hill)**: Stories emphasise the president’s optimism that tariffs will ‘come down substantially’ and portray the move as part of a hard-nosed yet ultimately friendly negotiation with Beijing likely to yield a quick deal. By prominently quoting Trump’s upbeat rhetoric and official talking points, they risk echoing White House messaging while under-playing how few concrete talks have actually begun, as the same articles quietly note.
