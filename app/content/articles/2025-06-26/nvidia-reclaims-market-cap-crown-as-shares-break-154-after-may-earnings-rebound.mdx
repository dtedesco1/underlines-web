# Nvidia Reclaims Market-Cap Crown as Shares Break $154 After May Earnings Rebound

On 25 Jun 2025 Nvidia closed at $154.31, topping its January record and briefly making it the world’s most valuable firm again after a 40% rally from April lows.

#### Focusing Facts

- Closing price 25 Jun 2025: $154.31 versus previous record $149.43 (6 Jan 2025).

- Market cap at close: $3.77 trillion, edging Microsoft’s $3.66 trillion and Apple’s $3.01 trillion.

- Trump’s April export ban on H20 chips is projected to cut Q2 revenue by $8 billion, yet shares are up 14% since the 28 May earnings beat.

#### Context

Wall Street has seen this movie before: in March 2000 Cisco briefly topped global market-cap tables days before the dot-com crash, and in 1985 IBM’s chip rivalry with Japan triggered tariffs that reshaped the semiconductor map. Nvidia’s surge sits at the confluence of two long arcs—capital chasing perceived platform shifts (railroads 1870s, PCs 1980s, mobile 2007) and states weaponising supply chains (from CoCom controls in the Cold War to today’s U.S.–China tech embargoes). The immediate pop may matter little in a century, but the underlying shift—general-purpose computing giving way to “accelerated” AI silicon locked behind proprietary ecosystems—could mark a structural pivot akin to the 1971 debut of Intel’s 4004. Whether Nvidia’s current monopoly endures or, like RCA’s in radio or Nokia’s in phones, unravels under new paradigms will determine if this week is remembered as a peak or merely an early waypoint in computing’s generational cycle.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **U.S. financial news outlets such as Yahoo! Finance and CNBC**: Present Nvidia’s new record highs as evidence the company’s AI dominance is intact despite export bans, stressing bullish price targets and market-leading fundamentals. Need to keep readers engaged with a feel-good market narrative and rely on Wall Street sources, so risks around valuation bubbles or China sales shortfalls are played down or mentioned only in passing.

Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-jumps-to-highest-levels-since-january-with-record-high-close-in-sight-183528480.html), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/25/nvidia-shares-head-for-record-close-wall-street-shrugs-off-china-.html))

- **International business press including The Economic Times and Markets Insider**: Acknowledge the stock’s rally but question whether the momentum can last given lost China revenues, export curbs and looming demand uncertainties. Catering to more risk-averse global investors and click-throughs on cautionary headlines, they accentuate downside scenarios and could overstate the drag from China to balance against U.S. market euphoria.

- **Retail-oriented investing outlets like The Motley Fool**: Argue Nvidia will keep smashing expectations, possibly split its stock again and remain the standout Magnificent Seven pick for years. As subscription stock-picking services, they have incentives to spotlight dramatic upside stories and may gloss over sector cyclicality or geopolitical risks to sustain reader enthusiasm.
