# India Extracts Data from Air India AI-171 Front Black Box, Keeps Recorders Onshore

On 25 June 2025 the AAIB successfully downloaded memory from the Dreamliner’s forward flight recorder in its Delhi lab, the first concrete investigative breakthrough since the 12 June crash.

#### Focusing Facts

- Crash-protection module opened and data pulled at 14:00–15:00 IST on 25 June 2025 inside AAIB’s new DFDR/CVR lab.

- Both CVR and FDR were recovered by 16 June and flown under armed escort to Delhi on 24 June after a 12-day security seal in Ahmedabad.

- The probe team includes U.S. NTSB representatives under ICAO Annex 13, but India has not shipped the recorders abroad despite 24-June media speculation.

#### Context

India’s insistence on decoding the recorders at home echoes Canada’s decision after the 1998 Swissair 111 crash to keep analysis within its newly built TSB lab, contrasting with the 1985 Air-India 182 bombing when data had to be read in the U.K. The move fits a broader two-decade push for technological self-reliance—seen also in ISRO’s in-house telemetry systems and the April 2025 inauguration of AAIB’s ‘Black Box Lab’. Domestically handled forensics may strengthen sovereignty but raises perennial questions about investigative independence; similar doubts trailed Russia’s handling of the 2010 Smolensk crash. Over a 100-year horizon, each large crash typically triggers regulatory leaps: the 1974 Turkish Airlines DC-10 loss led to cargo-door redesigns, and India’s 2020 Calicut over-run spurred runway-end safety zones. Whether AI-171 yields comparable systemic change will hinge on what the freshly recovered bytes reveal—but the very existence of a local decoding capability marks a structural shift that could shape South Asian aviation oversight for decades.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian business outlets closely echoing government statements (Economic Times, Deccan Chronicle)**: Report that the AAIB has already downloaded data from the front black-box and is competently running the investigation entirely inside India, portraying the retrieval as orderly and on-schedule. Stories lean heavily on ministerial press releases and avoid discussing delays or outside help, so the coverage implicitly burnishes the government’s technical prowess while downplaying any controversy about transparency or capability. ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-plane-crash-black-box-data-downloaded-may-disclose-sequence-of-events-that-led-to-deadly-accident/articleshow/122086878.cms), [Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/ahmedabad-air-india-plane-crash-aviation-minister-reveals-whereabouts-of-crashed-air-india-planes-black-box-civial-aviation-minister-naidu/articleshow/122043405.cms))

- **Mass-circulation Indian newspapers highlighting procedural gaps (The Times of India)**: Acknowledge the black-box data download but stress that the probe team was named late and no preliminary report has surfaced, implicitly questioning the pace and thoroughness of the inquiry and noting U.S. NTSB participation. By foregrounding lag and foreign involvement, the reporting casts the investigation as sluggish and possibly deficient, which can amplify public frustration and boost readership through a more critical narrative.

- **International newswires and foreign outlets (Reuters, 7NEWS.com.au)**: Frame the story around earlier speculation that the recorders might have to be shipped abroad for decoding and stress continuing uncertainty while also focusing on the high death toll and ongoing victim identification. Highlighting foreign-lab speculation and casualty figures can subtly suggest India lacks the technical capacity and keep a dramatic angle alive for global audiences, even though officials deny the need to send the black box overseas.
