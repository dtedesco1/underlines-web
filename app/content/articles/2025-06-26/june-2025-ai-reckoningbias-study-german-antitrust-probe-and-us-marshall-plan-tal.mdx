# June 2025 ‘AI Reckoning’—Bias Study, German Antitrust Probe, and U.S. Marshall-Plan Talk Converge

Within 48 hours, a damning study on hiring-bias, a German competition hearing on cloud-AI lock-ins, and Washington chatter about a multibillion-dollar ‘AI Marshall Plan’ signalled the first coordinated political-economic pushback against unfettered AI deployment.

#### Focusing Facts

- Karvonen & Marks (pub. early June, publicised 24 Jun 2025) showed six leading LLMs cut interview-recommendations for identical white-male résumés by up to 12 %.

- On 25 Jun 2025 Germany’s Bundeskartellamt gathered 14 domestic firms to assess whether AWS, Google Cloud & Microsoft’s control of data/GPU supply warrants antitrust action.

- Axios (25 Jun 2025) revealed White House and Congress are weighing a bipartisan committee and large-scale public spending—likened to the 1948 Marshall Plan—to secure chips, energy and data for AI leadership.

#### Context

Moments when breakthrough tech meets public backlash often mark turning points: in 1887 the Interstate Commerce Act reined in rail monopolies; in 1971 Griggs v. Duke Power forced employers to prove hiring tests weren’t discriminatory. Today’s AI flash-points echo both. The bias findings revive civil-rights concerns, while Europe’s probe recalls the 1998 Microsoft antitrust case—only this time the bottleneck is cloud compute, not operating systems. Simultaneously, U.S. leaders float a Marshall-style industrial policy, mirroring Cold-War investments in semiconductors and GPS. Whether these threads harden into regulation or fade like early 2010s privacy pushes will shape who controls the digital means of production for decades; in a century’s view, this week may mark the moment AI shifted from corporate sandbox to contested public infrastructure.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning media (e.g., The Daily Wire)**: Citing new research, they claim popular AI hiring tools now tilt against white male job-seekers, proving that "bias-busting" safeguards actually hurt the most qualified candidates. By spotlighting perceived ‘reverse discrimination,’ they amplify a broader culture-war narrative and gloss over longstanding inequities that AI might still encode against minorities.

- **Tech-industry and investor press (e.g., CRN, ZDNet)**: They present AI as the heart of tomorrow’s growth—fueling new cybersecurity services, spawning whole job categories and offering rich upside for companies bold enough to invest now. Because their audiences profit from rapid adoption, they downplay monopoly risks and job losses while emphasizing upbeat talking points from vendors and executives.

- **Regulatory and workplace-safety voices (e.g., TheRegister.com, Digiday)**: They warn that unchecked AI could entrench Big-Tech gatekeepers, jeopardize employee transparency and require stricter oversight to protect competition, privacy and fair workplaces. Alarm over corporate power and data misuse may inflate worst-case scenarios and favor heavier regulation that could slow beneficial innovation.
