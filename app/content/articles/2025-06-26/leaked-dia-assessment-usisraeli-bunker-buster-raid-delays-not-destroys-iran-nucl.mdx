# Leaked DIA Assessment: US–Israeli Bunker-Buster Raid Delays, Not Destroys, Iran Nuclear Program

A classified Defense Intelligence Agency report leaked on 24 Jun 2025 says the 22 Jun U.S. strikes on Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan will delay Iran’s enrichment effort only "a few months," contradicting public claims of total obliteration by President Trump and PM Netanyahu.

#### Focusing Facts

- DIA’s preliminary battle-damage review finds centrifuges at Fordow/Natanz remain restart-capable and Iran’s ~400 kg stockpile of 60 % enriched uranium had been moved before the attack.

- Strike package of 14 GBU-57 30,000-lb bunker-busters and ~30 Tomahawks failed to penetrate 45–90 m of bedrock shielding Fordow, leaving core infrastructure largely intact.

- White House postponed 24 Jun congressional briefings and opened an FBI probe into the leak of the top-secret assessment.

#### Context

Airpower’s limits against hardened nuclear targets echo Israel’s 1981 Osirak raid and NATO’s 1999 attempts to collapse Serbian command bunkers—both bought time but not capitulation. This episode fits a long-running pattern: dispersed, buried, and knowledge-based nuclear programs outpace the destructive power of conventional ordnance. It highlights the systemic tension between kinetic non-proliferation gambits and the diplomatic architecture of the 1968 NPT; if Tehran now exits that treaty, the strike could mark an inflection point in the century-long struggle to contain nuclear diffusion, potentially normalising pre-emptive force and accelerating regional arms races far beyond the Middle East.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning and international mainstream media (e.g., The Guardian, BBC, CNN, Washington Post, NPR, Reuters)**: Report leaked DIA findings that the U.S. air-strikes only delayed Iran’s nuclear program by a few months, directly contradicting President Trump’s claim of total destruction. Coverage leans on anonymous intelligence sources and highlights presidential exaggeration, likely amplifying the narrative of Trump’s failure while giving limited weight to uncertainties in a preliminary assessment.

- **Right leaning media (e.g., Fox News)**: Echo administration statements that the strikes "obliterated" Iran’s nuclear facilities and denounce the leaked assessment as politically motivated "fake news." Close alignment with Trump officials leads to dismissing contradictory Pentagon intelligence and framing critical outlets as unpatriotic, potentially overstating the battlefield success.
