# Judge Chhabria Tosses Authors’ Copyright Suit Against Meta’s Llama Training

On 25 June 2025 a San Francisco federal court granted Meta summary judgment because the 13 suing authors failed to prove its AI training harmed the market for their books.

#### Focusing Facts

- Ruling issued 25 Jun 2025 by U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria (N.D. Cal.) dismissed all major claims against Meta under the fair-use doctrine.

- Plaintiffs—among them Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates—alleged Meta ingested millions of LibGen-sourced pirated books to train Llama, a claim first filed in 2023.

- The decision notes the authors barely argued the “market dilution” theory the judge called a “potentially winning argument.”

#### Context

Copyright fights have trailed every major information technology: the 1909 piano-roll cases, the Sony Betamax ruling (1984), and Google Books’ decade-long litigation that ended in 2016 all began with courts groping to fit new copying machines into old statutes. This ruling is another early tremor in that lineage. It reflects a structural trend: data-hungry AI models need vast text corpora, while U.S. copyright law still pivots on 20th-century assumptions about discrete works and markets. By deciding on evidentiary inadequacy rather than issuing a broad endorsement of AI scraping, the court signals that future plaintiffs who quantify market harm—or lawmakers who clarify compulsory licensing—could still upend the current tech advantage. A century from now, precedent set in these 2020s cases may determine whether creative labor is compensated in an algorithmic economy or whether, as with the print explosion after Gutenberg (ca. 1450s), the pendulum again swings toward unrestricted reproduction before new guilds and rules emerge.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left-leaning media (e.g., The Guardian)**: Treats the decision as a narrowly-won, procedural victory for Meta that still signals serious legal peril for AI companies and highlights the threat generative AI poses to authors’ livelihoods. Coverage repeatedly foregrounds Big Tech ‘pirating’ language and creators’ vulnerability, reflecting a longstanding scepticism of large corporate power and an audience sympathetic to labor and creative rights.

- **Business & financial press (e.g., Financial Times, Bloomberg Law)**: Frames the ruling as a significant win for Meta and, by extension, for the wider AI industry because the court accepted a fair-use defence and avoided market-harm findings. By focusing on how the judgment boosts tech companies, investor confidence and market valuations, it downplays unresolved copyright questions that could hurt future profits, mirroring the outlets’ incentive to cater to business and investor interests.
