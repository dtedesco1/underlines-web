# US Court OKs Copyrighted Books for AI Training, Sends Anthropic to Trial Over 7 M Pirated Copies

On 24 June 2025, Judge William Alsup issued the first U.S. ruling that large-language models may lawfully train on copyrighted books under fair-use, but refused to dismiss allegations that Anthropic built its dataset with millions of pirated files, which will now proceed to trial.

#### Focusing Facts

- Alsup granted partial summary judgment for Anthropic, holding its Claude model’s training on authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson’s books is “exceedingly transformative” and therefore fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107.

- The same order cites Anthropic’s download and retention of roughly 7 million illicitly sourced books as “inherently, irredeemably infringing,” scheduling a jury trial (currently set for December 2025) to determine damages that could reach $150,000 per work.

- Alsup ruled Anthropic’s storage of the authors’ works in a central digital library violates copyright, even though some titles were later purchased legally.

#### Context

From the 1909 Piano Roll cases to Google Books (settled 2015) and the 1984 Sony Betamax decision, every new copying technology has tested U.S. copyright’s balance between protection and progress. Alsup’s opinion slots generative AI into that lineage: training data is likened to readers absorbing style rather than machines republishing text. The ruling reinforces a decades-long trend of courts broadening fair-use for transformative, non-market-substituting uses, which has historically unlocked whole industries—think photocopying (1973 Williams & Wilkins) or search engines. Yet the parallel piracy claim echoes Napster (2001): the medium’s promise does not immunize theft of source files. Over a 100-year horizon, this moment may mark the legal green light that lets AI developers ingest the world’s written patrimony, accelerating knowledge synthesis much as mass-market paperbacks once did, while drawing a bright line that unlicensed acquisition remains actionable. Whether legislators tighten that line or a licensing market emerges will shape the economic power of authors—and the informational commons—for generations.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Tech industry press (e.g., Wired, Ars Technica, Engadget, Decrypt)**: The ruling is a landmark affirmation that AI training on copyrighted books is transformative fair use, clearing a vital legal path for innovation in generative AI. These outlets cater to tech-savvy audiences and advertisers, so they tend to spotlight the benefits for startups while giving comparatively scant attention to authors lost control or compensation.

- **Entertainment industry trade press (e.g., The Hollywood Reporter)**: The decision is ominous for film and media studios because it strengthens AI companies fair-use shield, potentially undermining studios own copyright claims in future disputes. Relying on studio insiders and rights-holders for scoops, this coverage dramatizes threats to Hollywood to keep its core readership engaged and aligned with studio litigation strategies.

- **International outlets focused on policy and power dynamics (e.g., Al Jazeera Online, BBC)**: While the judge accepted AI training as fair use, the case illustrates how powerful tech firms leverage legal gray areas and political influence, leaving authors to fight costly battles over piracy and regulation. By framing the story as another example of Big Tech overreach, these outlets accentuate global inequities and regulatory gaps, a narrative that resonates with audiences skeptical of U.S. tech dominance.
