# Shell’s Rule-2.8 Denial Halts Rumoured £60 bn BP Takeover for Six Months

Hours after a Wall Street Journal scoop sent BP shares up nearly 10 % on 25 Jun 2025, Shell issued a formal Rule 2.8 statement saying “no talks are taking place,” which legally bars it from bidding for BP until late-December.

#### Focusing Facts

- BP stock jumped 7-10 % intraday on 25 Jun 2025 before Shell’s denial, adding roughly $6 bn to its $80 bn market value.

- Shell’s Rule 2.8 declaration under the U.K. Takeover Code means it cannot make another approach to BP for at least six months unless a rival bidder emerges or the Panel grants a waiver.

- A merged Shell-BP would have exceeded £200 bn ($300 bn) in equity value, rivaling ExxonMobil and Chevron in scale.

#### Context

Sudden mega-merger rumors evoke the late-1990s super-major wave—BP-Amoco (1998, $48 bn) and Exxon-Mobil (1999, $81 bn)—when low oil prices pushed companies to bulk up. Today the driver is different: U.S. rivals, flush from shale and recent deals like Exxon’s $60 bn Pioneer buy (2023), now tower over Europe’s climate-pressured majors. BP’s mis-timed 2020 green pivot and 30 % share-price slide made it a plausible target, while activist Elliott sharpened the spotlight. Shell’s public knock-back shows how the U.K.’s strict takeover rules can freeze market speculation—much like Pfizer’s aborted 2014 pursuit of AstraZeneca, which was also thwarted by a cooling-off period. Whether consolidation resumes hinges on two structural forces: 1) capital flight from European fossil stocks toward U.S. champions, and 2) the longer-term tension between scale in hydrocarbons and the capital-intensive transition to low-carbon energy. In a century-long view, Shell’s denial matters less than the trend it illuminates: the Western oil majors are navigating their end-game strategies in a decarbonising world, and each aborted megadeal clarifies who believes they can shrink gracefully versus who must merge to survive.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Financial press outlets (e.g., Financial Times, Reuters, Fortune)**: Present Shell’s categorical denial of any BP takeover talks as the decisive fact, framing the WSJ story as mere market speculation and stressing Shell’s current strategy of internal discipline and buy-backs. Heavy reliance on official company statements and an interest in maintaining market stability can lead these outlets to under-play unconfirmed deal chatter that could roil share prices. ([Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/0729b458-fb8c-471b-a404-504ae2d7dcad), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shell-says-no-talks-are-taking-place-after-wsj-reports-bp-takeover-discussions-2025-06-25/))

- **Investor-oriented business media (e.g., Investing.com, MoneyControl, Yahoo Finance)**: Echo the Wall Street Journal’s sourcing to report that Shell and BP are in active, early-stage merger discussions that could create the biggest oil deal in decades, stressing BP’s openness and the potential market impact. Deal-scoop incentives and the need to give traders actionable information can push these publications to amplify anonymously sourced rumours before they are corroborated, potentially overstating the likelihood of a transaction.

- **Left-leaning media (e.g., The Guardian)**: Highlights that talks, if true, would forge a £200 bn oil behemoth while underlining BP’s troubles after its failed green strategy and noting the political and environmental stakes of such consolidation. A traditional scepticism toward Big Oil and focus on climate implications may lead to accentuating BP’s ‘botched’ net-zero efforts and the enlarged company’s potential to resist energy-transition pressures.
