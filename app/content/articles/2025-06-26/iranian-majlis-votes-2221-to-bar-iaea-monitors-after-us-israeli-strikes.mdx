# Iranian Majlis Votes 222–1 to Bar IAEA Monitors After US-Israeli Strikes

On 25 June 2025, Iran’s parliament overwhelmingly passed a bill freezing all on-site inspections, cameras and reporting to the IAEA until Tehran deems its nuclear facilities secure, stripping the UN watchdog of real-time access for the first time since 2003.

#### Focusing Facts

- Vote count: 222 in favour, 1 abstention, 0 opposed in the 290-seat Majlis.

- Legislation still requires approval from the Guardian Council and the Supreme National Security Council before it becomes law.

- Text halts installation of new surveillance cameras and suspends existing inspections at Fordow, Natanz, Isfahan and other declared sites.

#### Context

Iran last curtailed IAEA access in February 2021, but kept some monitoring gear running; the only historical parallel this sweeping is North Korea’s 1994 expulsion of inspectors that preceded its bomb test twelve years later.  The move caps a two-week cycle in which Israel and the United States bombed three Iranian nuclear complexes—an echo of Israel’s 1981 Osirak raid and the covert Stuxnet attacks of 2010—yet, as in those cases, kinetic strikes have pushed the targeted state to harden rather than abandon its programme.  Strategically, the vote spotlights two converging long-term trends: (1) the gradual erosion of the post-1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty enforcement architecture as mid-level powers question its ability to shield them, and (2) the increasing use of the IAEA as a political cudgel by both Western and regional actors, undermining the agency’s perceived neutrality.  On a century horizon, whether Tehran ultimately ratifies this suspension will signal if the NPT regime can survive coercive non-compliance tactics; a permanent break would accelerate a Middle-East proliferation cascade, while a later climb-down would join the list of periodic crises that the rules-based order has weathered since the Cuban-missile inspections of 1962.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning US media (e.g., New York Post, Breitbart)**: Portrays Iran’s vote to bar the IAEA as a belligerent act from a regime that chants “Death to America” and shuns oversight, reinforcing fears that Tehran is racing toward a bomb and that the UN agency itself is hostile to Israel. Pro-Israel, anti-Iran framing leans on emotive language and selective details, minimizing the impact of preceding U.S./Israeli strikes or any Iranian legal arguments while amplifying worst-case nuclear scenarios.

- **Middle-Eastern media (Al Jazeera Online)**: Presents the suspension of IAEA cooperation as a defensive, conditional response to U.S. and Israeli attacks that ‘torpedoed diplomacy,’ stressing Iran’s stated right to peaceful nuclear energy and highlighting doubts about IAEA credibility. Critical of the U.S. and Israel and broadly sympathetic to Iran, it foregrounds casualty figures and Western responsibility while giving less scrutiny to Tehran’s enrichment activities and past opacity.

- **Left-leaning / progressive Western media (The New Republic, The Guardian)**: Argues that Trump’s strike has already backfired by pushing Iran to end transparency, complicating damage assessment, and exposing the strategic folly of U.S. hard-line tactics. Focus on condemning Trump and Western hawkishness may underplay Iran’s own provocations and the IAEA’s documented concerns, framing events chiefly as a U.S. policy failure.
