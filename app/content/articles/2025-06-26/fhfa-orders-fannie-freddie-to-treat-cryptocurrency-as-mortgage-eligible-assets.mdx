# FHFA Orders Fannie & Freddie to Treat Cryptocurrency as Mortgage-Eligible Assets

On 25 June 2025, FHFA Director Bill Pulte ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to start counting borrowers’ crypto holdings in mortgage underwriting, overturning the long-standing requirement that digital coins be converted to dollars first.

#### Focusing Facts

- Signed directive dated 25 June 2025 tasks the two GSEs with drafting crypto-asset underwriting standards that allow digital assets to remain on-chain at closing.

- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back more than half of U.S. home loans—about $4 trillion in outstanding mortgages—so their rules set the benchmark for most lenders.

- Pulte, sworn in as FHFA chief on 14 Mar 2025, disclosed personal stakes of up to $1 million each in Bitcoin and Solana.

#### Context

Washington has periodically expanded what counts as mortgage collateral—from Veterans’ GI Bill benefits in 1944 to stock-option income in the late-1990s tech boom—often during moments of political zeal for widening credit.  The new crypto directive echoes 2005–06 decisions to accept lightly documented assets just before the subprime crash: innovation chasing growth amid uncertain risk models.  It also recalls the 1981 rollout of adjustable-rate mortgages that looked small at first but reshaped housing finance over decades.  Long-term, integrating a 24/7, highly volatile global asset class into federally backed lending tests the century-old assumption that home finance rests on predictable cash flows; it could either normalize digital money—much as the 1934 FHA program normalized 30-year fixed loans—or inject new systemic fragility.  In a 100-year view, the order is a milestone in the slow convergence of decentralized finance and state-supported credit markets, but its ultimate importance will hinge on whether risk-management tools mature faster than crypto’s boom-bust cycles.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Crypto industry media (Cointelegraph, CoinDesk, Decrypt, CryptoSlate, cryptonews.com)**: Portrays the FHFA order as a landmark step that could unlock home-ownership for millions and further legitimizes Bitcoin and other tokens as mainstream financial collateral. These outlets cater to crypto investors and evangelists, so they highlight upside while playing down warnings about price volatility and systemic mortgage-market risk mentioned even within their own reporting.

- **Mainstream business press (Reuters, CNBC, Investing.com)**: Frames the directive as a notable policy shift under Trump that could broaden borrower asset profiles, while repeatedly flagging crypto’s extreme price swings and the operational questions Fannie and Freddie now face. Serving market-focused readers, coverage emphasizes regulatory and market implications that can move asset prices, giving less space to consumer-protection or housing-stability concerns.

- **Tech-skeptic news outlets (Gizmodo)**: Characterizes the plan as reckless, likening it to pre-2008 risk-taking and warning that injecting "volatile internet tokens" into mortgage finance could spell chaos. The dramatic tone and mocking references court clicks from a tech-savvy audience, potentially discounting any genuine innovation or risk-management frameworks the FHFA might adopt.
