# India Inks ₹63,000-Crore Deal for 26 Rafale-M Carrier Fighters

After a brief postponement, New Delhi and Paris on 28 Apr 2025 signed an inter-governmental agreement to supply 26 Rafale-Marine jets to the Indian Navy, locking in the service’s first Western carrier fighters.

#### Focusing Facts

- Contract value: ₹630 billion (≈ US$7.4 billion) signed on 28 Apr 2025 by Defence Ministers Rajnath Singh and Sébastien Lecornu via virtual ceremony.

- Fleet mix: 22 single-seat Rafale-M and 4 twin-seat trainers, with all deliveries slated for completion by 2031-32.

- Deal incorporates performance-based logistics, training, and offset provisions for Indian production of Rafale components.

#### Context

India’s turn toward French naval aviation echoes its 1982 Mirage-2000 purchase—another time it bypassed Soviet hardware for French jets amid regional insecurity. Strategically, the contract underlines two converging trends: New Delhi’s slow decoupling from Russian kit after the 2022–24 supply crunch, and its urgency to field carrier air wings that can shadow China’s expanding 2017-present Indian Ocean forays. Over a century-scale horizon, the significance is less the 26 airframes than the industrial foot-in-door: if France localises Rafale production and India completes its indigenous Twin-Engine Deck-Based Fighter in the 2030s, the subcontinent could shift from net importer to co-producer of high-end combat aircraft—altering the global arms supply map much as post-1950 Japanese shipbuilding remade maritime trade by the 1970s.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian nationalist or pro-government media (e.g., Zee News, Republic World)**: Portrays the Rafale-Marine purchase as a ‘historic’ milestone that urgently strengthens the Navy and showcases India’s defence modernisation push. Tends to celebrate the Modi government’s achievement while glossing over the Rs 63,000-crore price tag, delays and any procurement controversy, aligning with a patriotic narrative found in both articles.

- **International wire services (e.g., Reuters)**: Frames the deal primarily as part of India’s broader strategy to modernise forces, diversify away from Russian equipment and counter China’s growing presence in the Indian Ocean. By focusing on the geopolitical angle for a global readership, the coverage downplays domestic political optics or cost–benefit debates that matter more inside India.

- **Pakistani media (e.g., Dawn)**: Highlights India’s rapid military build-up and its replacement of Russian jets, implicitly underscoring a regional arms race dynamic that affects Pakistan’s security calculus. May accentuate India’s militarisation to legitimise Pakistan’s own defence spending and reinforce domestic perceptions of an escalating threat from New Delhi.
