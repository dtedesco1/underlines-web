# Microsoft Locks In Paid Security and AI Push as Windows 10 Sunset Nears

In late April 2025 Microsoft set July 1 as the start of a $1.50-per-core monthly ‘hotpatch’ fee for Windows Server 2025 and reminded users that free Windows 10 support stops 14 Oct 2025, triggering a rush of third-party $14.97 Windows 11 Pro license flash-sales and a flurry of AI-centric 24H2 updates.

#### Focusing Facts

- From 1 Jul 2025, Hotpatch subscriptions for Windows Server 2025 Standard/Datacenter cost US $1.50 per CPU core per month and require Azure Arc connectivity.

- Microsoft’s free security updates for Windows 10 cease on 14 Oct 2025; optional Extended Security Updates are priced at US $30 per PC for the first year.

- Entrepreneur, Mashable and other affiliates advertised lifetime Windows 11 Pro keys at US $14.97—92% below Microsoft’s US $199 list price—expiring 27 Apr 2025.

#### Context

Microsoft has played this end-of-life card before: when Windows XP support ended on 8 Apr 2014, paid ESU contracts and last-minute discounts nudged enterprises to newer platforms, while pushing consumers toward Windows 7/8. Today’s maneuver repeats the pattern but with two 21st-century twists: (1) a cloud tether—Hotpatch only works if servers are linked to Azure Arc, echoing IBM’s 1960s ‘rental’ model that bound customers to its datacenters; and (2) an AI layer—features like Recall and on-device language models make the OS itself a service that thrives on constant data ingestion. The bargain-basement license keys suggest a grey-market clearing of inventory reminiscent of Office 2010 fire-sales, revealing Microsoft’s tacit tolerance for unofficial channels so long as the install base moves forward. Over a 100-year arc, the shift inches personal computing from a one-off product toward a metered utility: security, uptime and even basic functions become subscription line items, while intelligence moves to the edge NPUs. Whether users gain productivity or merely trade autonomy for convenience will define the next cycle of the Microsoft ecosystem.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Deal-oriented tech commerce media (Entrepreneur, Mashable)**: Pushes the idea that upgrading to Windows 11 Pro right now is a rare bargain, framing the $14.97 license keys or $54.97 software bundles as the smart, time-limited way to stay secure and productive. These outlets earn affiliate commissions from every sale, so their coverage spotlights discounts and glosses over questions about grey-market keys, long-term support costs, or feature trade-offs.

- **Upgrade-enthusiast tech tutorial sites (MakeUseOf, How-To Geek, TechPowerUp)**: Argues that Windows 11 has finally matured—offering polished features, AI tools, and compatibility options—so users should embrace the new OS and use built-in tricks to smooth any bumps. Focused on tips and new capabilities for early adopters, these pieces underplay hardware requirements, enterprise costs, or the possibility that some users may actually prefer staying on Windows 10.

- **Critical watchdog tech press (Forbes, Neowin)**: Highlights Microsoft’s continuing missteps—from nickel-and-diming customers with a $1.50 per-core security fee to lingering design annoyances—casting doubt on the company’s upgrade push. By foregrounding controversies and pain points these outlets can attract engaged, frustrated readers, so their framing may exaggerate worst-case scenarios or overlook recent fixes that don’t fit the narrative.
