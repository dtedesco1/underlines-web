# Beijing Forces Antitrust Scrutiny of $22.8 B CK Hutchison–BlackRock Panama Ports Sale

On 27 Apr 2025 China’s State Administration for Market Regulation warned CK Hutchison and the BlackRock-led consortium that their planned sale—covering 43 foreign ports including two terminals on the Panama Canal—cannot proceed or be partially carved out unless it wins formal Chinese antitrust approval.

#### Focusing Facts

- CK Hutchison is selling an 80% stake in its overseas ports arm (enterprise value: US$22.8 billion) spanning 43 ports in 23 countries.

- The SAMR statement, issued 27 Apr 2025, threatens unspecified “legal liability” if the transaction moves forward before approval.

- U.S. President Trump on 26 Apr 2025 demanded toll-free passage for American ships through the Panama and Suez canals, calling the deal a U.S. “reclaiming” of the waterway.

#### Context

Great powers have long fought over maritime choke-points: in 1904 Roosevelt backed the Panama Canal’s construction, and in 1999 the U.S. ceded control to Panama under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties—moves that still echo today.  Beijing’s public flex of antitrust muscle mirrors Washington’s 2006 blocking of Dubai Ports World’s U.S. terminal purchase: competition law is again serving as strategic veto power.  The episode fits a two-decade trend of major economies repurposing regulatory tools (CFIUS, SAMR, FDI screenings) to police foreign influence over logistics arteries, foreshadowing a more fragmented, state-directed global trade architecture.  On a century horizon the spat matters less for the deal’s cash flows than for what it signals: that control of nodes like the Panama Canal is reverting from multilateral commerce to bilateral power politics—an early 20th-century dynamic resurfacing in the mid-21st.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Pro-Beijing and China-focused press (e.g., South China Morning Post, Ta Kung Pao quotes in The Straits Times)**: Argues that Beijing’s antitrust probe is essential to protect China’s strategic interests and prevent a ‘betrayal’ of national assets at the Panama Canal. Coverage echoes official rhetoric that stresses sovereignty and may overstate the threat of the sale to justify tighter state control over Hong Kong-based conglomerates.

- **Western business media (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg, Economic Times)**: Frames the CK Hutchison deal chiefly as a major corporate transaction that now faces regulatory and geopolitical headwinds amid US-China trade tensions. Market-oriented lens tends to neutralise ideological stakes and foreground investor concerns, possibly downplaying nationalist motives on either side.

- **Regional and online outlets spotlighting the geopolitical drama (e.g., Free Malaysia Today, Devdiscourse)**: Highlight the intensifying war of words between Washington and Beijing, casting the ports sale as a flash-point in a broader struggle for control of global trade routes. Reliance on secondary reporting and sensational angles can exaggerate confrontation to attract readership, offering limited original sourcing on the deal’s mechanics.
