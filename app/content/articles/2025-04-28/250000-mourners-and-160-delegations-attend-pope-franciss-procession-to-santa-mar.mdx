# 250,000 Mourners and 160+ Delegations Attend Pope Francis’s Procession to Santa Maria Maggiore

On 26 April 2025, a pared-down but massive funeral Mass in St. Peter’s Square drew roughly 250,000 people and 164 national delegations before Pope Francis’s coffin was walked and driven 3.4 miles through Rome to be privately interred in Santa Maria Maggiore.

#### Focusing Facts

- By noon on 25 April, over 150,000 pilgrims had already filed past Francis’s body during the three-day lying-in-state, Vatican officials said.

- Francis is the first pope in more than 100 years to be buried outside the Vatican walls, in an unadorned niche inscribed only “Franciscus.”

- Italian security blanketed the capital with a no-fly zone, anti-drone jammers, and 2,000 officers guarding the square, reflecting the presence of 50 heads of state and 10 reigning monarchs.

#### Context

State funerals for charismatic pontiffs have long doubled as global barometers: John Paul II’s 2005 rites (3 April–8 April) drew some 300,000 and signaled the high-water mark of post-Cold-War Catholic soft power; Benedict XVI’s 2023 funeral, by contrast, was smaller and symbolized a retreating papal influence. Francis’s send-off sits between those poles, marrying austerity—one wooden coffin, migrant honor guard—to unprecedented geopolitical complexity, with a newly re-elected Donald Trump, Zelenskyy, and rival blocs converging under heavy electronic counter-measures. The decision to rest outside the Vatican echoes Pius IX’s ultimately thwarted wish in 1878 to be buried at San Lorenzo, underscoring how Francis’s papacy re-centered Rome’s peripheral communities rather than its curia. On a century arc, the funeral crystallizes two long trends: the decoupling of moral authority from territorial power, and the Church’s struggle to remain a trans-national mediator amid resurgent nationalism and multipolar rivalry. Whether the next conclave deepens Francis’s outreach to the marginalized or swings back toward doctrinal retrenchment will shape the Catholic Church’s relevance as it approaches the year 2100.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Vatican-affiliated media (e.g., Vatican News)**: The funeral and ensuing Novemdiales highlight the universality of the Church and faithfully follow ancient rites that embody Pope Francis’ wish for humility and inclusion of “everyone, everyone, everyone.” Coverage stresses liturgical precision and the pope’s pastoral vision while skirting political tensions or criticism, reflecting the Holy See’s interest in projecting unity and downplaying controversy.

- **Left-leaning media (e.g., The Guardian)**: The funeral underscores Francis’s progressive legacy on migrants, peace and climate while being overshadowed by the diplomatic peril posed by Donald Trump and other global flashpoints. Reporting amplifies clashes with Trump and spotlights right-wing antagonists, aligning events with broader ideological battles and potentially overstating the likelihood of confrontation to critique conservative politics.

- **Global broadcast/straight-news outlets (e.g., BBC, CBS)**: The papal rites are framed as a large-scale media event, with detailed timelines, how-to-watch guides and emphasis on protocol, attendance figures and broadcast logistics for a worldwide audience. Focus on spectacle and viewer information can eclipse theological or political nuance, catering to ratings and broad appeal rather than probing the deeper moral debates surrounding the pope’s legacy.
