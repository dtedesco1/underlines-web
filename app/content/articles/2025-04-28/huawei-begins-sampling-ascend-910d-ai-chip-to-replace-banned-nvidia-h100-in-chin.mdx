# Huawei Begins Sampling Ascend 910D AI Chip to Replace Banned Nvidia H100 in China

On 27 April 2025 Huawei told domestic partners that first batches of its new Ascend 910D AI accelerator—touted as faster than Nvidia’s H100—will ship for testing in late May, opening a Chinese-made alternative after fresh U.S. export curbs.

#### Focusing Facts

- Sample Ascend 910D units are scheduled to reach Chinese tech companies in “late May 2025,” according to Wall Street Journal sources cited by multiple outlets.

- Huawei will simultaneously start mass shipments of >800,000 earlier Ascend 910C chips to local customers as early as June 2025.

- U.S. export bans removed Nvidia’s H100 from China in Oct 2022 and extended to the lower-power H20 on 15 Apr 2025, saddling Nvidia with a reported $5.5 billion inventory charge.

#### Context

Great-power tech races rarely hinge on a single part number, but they often crystallize around one.  In 1982 Japan’s NEC rolled out the V30 CPU to sidestep CoCom export limits, unsettling Intel’s 8086 supremacy much as Sputnik (1957) jolted U.S. rocket programs.  Huawei’s 910D emerges from the same logic of techno-nationalism: when access to the frontier is blocked, build your own frontier.  The chip sits at the confluence of two longer arcs: a century-long push for technological autarky in major powers (from Soviet Zelenograd in the 1960s to India’s recent PLI fabs) and the current U.S.–China decoupling that is redrawing supply chains around ideology as much as efficiency.  If the 910D proves genuinely competitive, it could cement a parallel, China-centric semiconductor ecosystem by the 2030s; if it fails, China may remain one process node behind.  Either way, on a 100-year timeline the episode illustrates how export controls often accelerate, rather than stop, the diffusion of critical technologies.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International mainstream news outlets (Reuters, Al Jazeera, The Express Tribune)**: Huawei’s Ascend 910D is an early-stage effort by China to lessen reliance on U.S. chips after export controls, illustrating the hurdles Chinese firms still face competing with Nvidia. By foregrounding U.S. sanctions and repeating Washington’s rationale, coverage can implicitly frame Huawei as a follower rather than a technological peer, mirroring Western policy interests.

- **Tech-enthusiast and specialist blogs (Wccftech, Mobile World Live, NewsBytes)**: The new Ascend 910D is poised to disrupt Nvidia’s grip on China’s AI market and may outperform the H100, showcasing Huawei’s growing technological edge. Excitable tone and sweeping performance claims rely on limited technical data, likely amplifying Huawei’s achievements to attract clicks and readers within gadget-focused communities.

- **Investor-focused finance and crypto media (Investing.com, Analytics Insight, Cointelegraph)**: Huawei’s chip could dent Nvidia’s revenue and stock performance, becoming a near-term competitive threat as Sino-U.S. trade tensions reshape semiconductor markets. Market-centric framing may overstate the immediacy of the threat to spur trading interest and page views, leaning on speculative analyst quotes rather than proven benchmarks.
