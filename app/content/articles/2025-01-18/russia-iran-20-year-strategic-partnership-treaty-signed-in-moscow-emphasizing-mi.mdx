On January 17, 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed a 20-year strategic partnership treaty, enhancing military and economic ties between the two countries as a counter to Western sanctions.

It reflects a trend of non-Western nations bolstering ties in response to sanctions and geopolitical shifts, heralding potential shifts in Middle Eastern power dynamics. This moment is pivotal for Iran's economic recovery and Russia's influence expansion amidst strained Western relations.
