# Israel Approves Ceasefire and Hostage Deal with Hamas Amid Long-standing Conflict

Israel's cabinet approves a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal with Hamas, marking a potential pause in the 15-month-long conflict in Gaza as of January 18, 2025.

#### Focusing Facts

- The ceasefire deal includes the release of 33 Israeli hostages held by Hamas and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners over six weeks.

- President-elect Donald Trump assured Israel that military actions against Hamas could resume if Hamas fails to comply with the agreement.

- Outgoing US President Joe Biden emphasized the long-term necessity for Israel to address Palestinian concerns for sustainable peace.

#### Context

The ceasefire deal echoes past ceasefires, such as the 2014 Gaza conflict truce, often characterized by temporary halts to violence but lacking substantive long-term peace. Historically, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict roots back to the 1948 formation of Israel and has been marked by territorial disputes and intermittent violence, with ongoing implications for regional geopolitics. This latest ceasefire, while a temporary reprieve, reflects enduring challenges of achieving lasting peace, analogous to ceasefires post-1948 Arab-Israeli War, and underscores the cyclical nature of this conflict. The emphasis comes amid rising international calls for accountability for alleged war crimes and global polarization over the Middle East conflict, potentially precipitating shifts in diplomatic alignments. The timing and nature of this ceasefire matter as they highlight both the persistent volatility in Gaza and the significant political shifts in international, particularly US, diplomatic stances toward the Middle East.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The Guardian, The Intercept)**: The left-leaning media views the ceasefire as a necessary but insufficient step towards resolving the underlying issues, emphasizing a history of oppression and violence against Palestinians, and expressing skepticism about long-term peace due to Israel's actions. These outlets may have ideological commitments that focus on human rights, leading to criticisms of Israel's actions and sympathy towards Palestinian struggles.

- **Right leaning media (e.g., Fox News)**: Right-leaning outlets perceive the ceasefire deal as flawed but necessary to secure the release of hostages, with concerns over compromising Israeli security and not completely dismantling Hamas. Their perspectives are influenced by a preference for strong national security measures and support for Israeli government decisions.

- **Arab and regional press (e.g., Dawn)**: Arab and regional media portray the ceasefire as a temporary halt in a long-standing oppression and violence against Palestinians, emphasizing the need for accountability for alleged war crimes by Israel. These perspectives may be driven by regional political dynamics and historical solidarity with the Palestinian cause. ([Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1885796))
