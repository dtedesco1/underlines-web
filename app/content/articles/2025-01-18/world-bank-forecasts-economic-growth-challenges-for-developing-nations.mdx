# World Bank Forecasts Economic Growth Challenges for Developing Nations

The World Bank projects a steady 2.7% global growth rate for 2025 and 2026, with developing countries facing a slow 4% growth, insufficient for substantial poverty reduction.

#### Focusing Facts

- India's economic growth is projected at 6.7% for the next two years according to the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects report.

- The global economy's growth rate of 2.7% matches the performance of previous years but is below the 2010-2019 average of 3.1%.

- Developing economies face the weakest long-term growth outlook since 2000, attributed to high debt and weak investment.

#### Context

Historically, the global economy has cyclically faced periods of sluggish growth, notably after major crises like the 2008-09 financial crash. The current outlook echoes the 1980s debt crisis, highlighting persistent systemic issues like high debt burdens and protectionism. Over the last three decades, economic integration saw developing economies like India and China prosper significantly. However, geopolitical tensions, rising climate change costs, and economic nationalism now challenge these dynamics. This forecast is pivotal as it marks a critical point where shifts in global trade policies could exacerbate inequalities or drive new partnerships, echoing historical realignments. The steadiness of growth, set against such a backdrop, lessens the likelihood of economic divergence required to significantly affect poverty or global inequality alone.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **The Economic Times and Times of India**: These articles highlight a more optimistic view about India's economic prospects, focusing on its ability to weather global economic slowdowns better than other emerging markets due to its large GDP and internal consumption-driven demand. There may be nationalistic or economic biases in focusing more on India's strengths while potentially downplaying global economic challenges.

- **Washington Post and Business Standard**: These sources emphasize the challenges and insufficient growth to alleviate poverty, with particular concern for developing nations falling behind as global inequality widens. There is a potential bias toward highlighting challenges faced by developing nations, which could magnify the negative aspects of slow global growth to stress urgency for policy changes.

- **Dawn and Tribune Online**: These articles present a view that global growth will remain steady yet low, primarily pointing out concerns about the impact on developing countries' ability to meet development goals. These media may have a regional focus which presents a narrative that emphasizes the struggles of developing countries, in line with regional economic concerns and perspectives.
