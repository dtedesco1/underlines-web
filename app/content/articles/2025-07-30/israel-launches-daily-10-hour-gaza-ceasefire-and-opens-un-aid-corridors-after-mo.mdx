# Israel Launches Daily 10-Hour Gaza Ceasefire and Opens UN Aid Corridors After Months-Long Blockade

Starting 27 Jul 2025, the IDF is halting operations 10 a.m.–8 p.m. daily in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah and Al-Mawasi and has authorised UN-escorted road corridors and renewed airdrops, reversing its March food cutoff amid intensifying famine accusations.

#### Focusing Facts

- Ceasefire windows run 10:00–20:00 local time; secure aid routes open 06:00–23:00, effective 27 Jul 2025 and ‘until further notice’.

- Only 4,500 aid trucks (≈69/day) entered Gaza between May and late July, far below the pre-war 500–600/day UN benchmark.

- Gaza Health Ministry lists 127 starvation deaths, 85 of them children, as of 27 Jul 2025.

#### Context

Siege-relief pauses like this echo Britain’s 1917 ‘Jericho Week’ truces during the Sinai–Palestine Campaign—brief, militarily convenient cessations that did little to alter civilian suffering.  Historically, starvation as a tactic—from Biafra (1967–70) to Sarajevo (1992–96)—has provoked global outrage and eventually diplomatic pressure on besieging forces; each case showed that air- or sea-borne relief could mitigate but rarely solve food crises without political settlement.  Israel’s grudging corridor scheme fits a century-long trend: modern states outsource humanitarian logistics (here to the U.S-registered Gaza Humanitarian Foundation) while contesting UN neutrality, reflecting a broader move toward privatised aid and information-warfare over famine narratives.  On a 100-year horizon, this moment matters less for the tonnage delivered than for the precedent it sets: if an occupying power can throttle aid for months, then restore trickles under pressure without legal consequence, future conflicts may normalise siege-induced famine despite the 1977 Additional Protocols.  Conversely, instantaneous imagery of starving toddlers, amplified by activists from Bob Geldof to José Andrés, shows how digital mass empathy can still bend state behaviour, however slightly—hinting that global civil society may yet reshape the laws of war in the decades ahead.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli government statements and aligned coverage (e.g., IDF releases carried by BBC)**: Insists there is no Israeli-caused famine, says aid is already flowing via the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and any shortages stem from UN or Hamas failures, while promising limited humanitarian corridors and pauses. Narrative protects Israel from war-crime allegations and shifts blame toward international agencies or Hamas, relying almost exclusively on official IDF communiqués that downplay documented starvation figures. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn437jjygl9o?xtor=AL-72-%255Bpartner%255D-%255Binforadio%255D-%255Bheadline%255D-%255Bnews%255D-%255Bbizdev%255D-%255Bisapi%255D), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn437jjygl9o))

- **Mainstream Western humanitarian-focused media (e.g., The New York Times, Washington Post)**: Portrays Gaza’s hunger crisis as a man-made catastrophe largely driven by the Israeli siege and aid restrictions, urging immediate corridors, massive food inflows and systemic change to avert famine. Emphasises civilian suffering and Israeli responsibility, which may underplay Hamas impediments or security concerns, reflecting liberal international-law and human-rights framing. ([The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/opinion/gaza-starvation-famine-israel.html), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2025/gaza-hunger-starvation-children-body/))

- **Activist and celebrity critics amplified by UK broadcasters (e.g., Sky News interviews with Bob Geldof)**: Flatly accuses Israeli leaders and the IDF of ‘lying’ and deliberately starving Gazans, asserting thousands of starvation deaths and condemning the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation as a façade. Highly emotive language and moral absolutism galvanise public outrage but provide scant sourcing or nuance on combat realities or Hamas actions, reflecting advocacy more than balanced reporting.
