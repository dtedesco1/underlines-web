# US–EU Strike 15 % Baseline Tariff Pact Four Days Before Deadline

On 27 July 2025, Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen agreed to cap the threatened tariff escalation at a uniform 15 % on EU goods while extracting promises of massive U.S. energy purchases and investments from Europe.

#### Focusing Facts

- The deal fixes a 15 % U.S. import tariff on most EU goods, averting the 30 %–50 % duties Trump had slated to take effect 1 August 2025.

- Europe pledged $750 billion in future U.S. energy imports and an additional $600 billion of investment inside the United States.

- Tariffs on EU steel and aluminium stay at the pre-existing 50 % level, unaffected by the accord.

#### Context

Washington’s hard-ball brinkmanship recalls the 1930 Smoot-Hawley build-up—tariffs were hiked but then selectively eased through 1934 reciprocal deals—and the 1981 Reagan-era auto ‘voluntary’ export restraints that coaxed foreign investment into U.S. plants.  This episode fits a century-long oscillation between U.S. protectionism and market-opening: each wave uses America’s outsized consumer market as leverage to secure energy, capital and defence sales.  What matters long-term is not the headline 15 % duty, which is historically moderate, but the precedent that the EU accepted bilateral, numbers-driven concessions rather than WTO arbitration—another brick pulled from the post-1947 multilateral trade order.  If repeated, that shift could normalise power-based bargaining reminiscent of pre-Great-Depression mercantilism, reshaping global commerce over the next hundred years; if not, the deal may be remembered as a transient election-season spectacle measured in unfulfilled nine-figure purchase pledges.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-wing populist, pro-Trump outlets (e.g., InfoWars)**: Portray the agreement as President Trump’s biggest trade triumph to date, extracting huge EU energy and investment commitments while dodging a full trade war. Cheerleads Trump’s negotiating prowess for an audience predisposed to celebrate him and glosses over that the eye-popping numbers may be exaggerated or unlikely to materialise, as even its own text admits.

- **European political critics quoted in regional media (e.g., ProtoThema, DT News)**: Frame the deal as a humiliating European submission to U.S. pressure, with French PM François Bayrou calling it a “dark day” for the EU. Driven by domestic European politics to signal toughness against Washington, it accentuates loss of sovereignty and downplays any relief from avoiding higher 30-50 % tariffs.

- **Mainstream international TV news networks (e.g., ITV Hub, NDTV)**: Depict the pact as a last-minute compromise that averts a looming transatlantic trade war by settling on a reduced 15 % tariff baseline. Leans on official statements and headline figures, potentially under-scrutinising the broader economic costs or the political theatre surrounding the ‘biggest-ever’ label.
