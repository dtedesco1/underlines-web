# India Launches $1.5 B NASA-ISRO NISAR Radar Satellite on GSLV-F16

At 17:40 IST on 30 July 2025, India’s GSLV-F16 is scheduled to lift the 2,392 kg dual-band NISAR radar into a 734 km sun-synchronous orbit, marking the first joint US-India Earth-observation spacecraft and the costliest civilian imaging satellite ever.

#### Focusing Facts

- Budget tops US$1.5 billion: NASA ~US$1.2 bn (L-band radar, reflector, comms) and ISRO ~₹788 cr/US$96 m (S-band radar, bus, launcher, ops).

- NISAR will scan virtually the entire globe every 12 days at centimetre-scale accuracy using combined L- and S-band SweepSAR, with open data released within one day (or real-time for emergencies).

- Flight is the GSLV’s first mission to insert a payload into sun-synchronous polar orbit and only its 9th operational outing with an indigenous cryogenic upper stage.

#### Context

Big, co-funded radar satellites are rare: NASA’s Seasat (1978) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (2000) each revolutionised Earth mapping, but both were US-led.  NISAR signals a shift toward multipolar, open-data space science, pairing US instrumentation with India’s increasingly capable – and frugal – launch and bus technology.  It reflects two long arcs: the century-old movement from nation-exclusive strategic imagery to globally shared geospatial “infrastructure,” and the ascent of emerging powers like India from 1975’s Russia-launched Aryabhata to today’s provider of launch services and radar payloads.  On a 100-year horizon, such collaborations could normalise near-real-time, centimetre-grade surveillance of the planet, empowering climate adaptation, disaster response and agriculture but also raising sovereignty and privacy dilemmas that earlier space treaties never envisaged.  Whether NISAR becomes a model—like Landsat’s 1972 open archive—or an expensive outlier will shape how humanity monitors a warming, increasingly crowded Earth through 2125.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian nationalist or pro-government outlets (e.g., Swarajyamag, India Today, Hindustan Times)**: Portray the launch as proof of India’s rising technological power and a shrewd bargain that lets New Delhi punch above its weight for only a fraction of the mission’s $1.5 billion price tag. This celebratory framing accentuates India’s contribution and cost-efficiency while skimming over the fact that NASA footed the larger bill and supplied the more complex L-band radar, amplifying national pride over balanced accounting.

- **U.S. and international science media (e.g., Space.com, The New York Times)**: Highlight NISAR as NASA’s 'most sophisticated radar' to date, stressing the satellite’s global scientific payoff and life-saving hazard monitoring rather than any single nation’s prestige. By foregrounding NASA’s superlatives and technical leadership, these pieces risk sidelining ISRO’s sizable hardware and launch role, reflecting a default U.S.–centric lens common in American science coverage.

- **Indian mainstream centrist outlets (e.g., NDTV, The Hindu, The Indian Express)**: Frame the mission as a model of equal-footed Indo-U.S. collaboration that marries ISRO’s frugal engineering with NASA’s advanced radar to deliver open, global data for disaster relief and climate science. While sounding even-handed, the narrative leans on feel-good diplomacy and inspirational quotes from ISRO officials, offering little scrutiny of schedule slips, technical risks or the affordability of similar future mega-missions.
