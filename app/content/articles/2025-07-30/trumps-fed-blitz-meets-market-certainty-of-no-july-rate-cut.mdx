# Trump’s Fed Blitz Meets Market Certainty of No July Rate Cut

In the week leading into the July 30 FOMC decision, President Trump staged an unprecedented on-camera visit to the Fed’s $2.5 billion renovation and demanded a 300-bp cut even as futures implied a 97 % chance rates stay at 4.25-4.50 %.

#### Focusing Facts

- CME FedWatch on 29 July showed a 96.9 % probability the Fed would hold its target range at 4.25 %-4.50 % for the fifth straight meeting.

- During a 24 July tour, Trump became only the fourth sitting president ever to enter Fed headquarters and publicly pressed Chair Powell for a 300 bp reduction.

- Simultaneously, Sen. Rand Paul re-filed an “Audit the Fed” bill, citing the Fed’s $186 billion 2024 interest-on-reserves payments—44 % to foreign banks—as evidence of secrecy.

#### Context

Moments when politicians badger central bankers usually echo loudly through history.  Richard Nixon’s 1971–72 pressure on Arthur Burns—documented in Oval Office tapes—helped set the stage for the double-digit inflation Volcker later had to crush in 1979–81.  Trump’s public brow-beating and threat to fire Powell revisit that playbook, but collide with a post-1951 Treasury–Fed Accord norm of formal independence and with global investors who still treat U.S. Treasuries as the risk-free benchmark.  Long-term, the episode highlights two structural stressors: (1) mounting fiscal interest costs that make cheap money politically irresistible, and (2) the Fed’s enlarged balance sheet, whose $186 billion annual interest bill to banks is now fodder for populists across the spectrum.  Whether the July standoff ends in a routine “no change” vote or a constitutional fight over Powell’s tenure, it is another data point in a century-long tension between democratic accountability and technocratic monetary power—one that will shape credibility, inflation expectations and dollar hegemony well beyond the 2025 election cycle.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning media (e.g., PJ Media, Fox Business, New York Post)**: Portray the Federal Reserve as an opaque, over-spending culprit behind economic woes and applaud Trump-backed efforts—from auditing the Fed to ousting Jerome Powell—to force aggressive rate cuts. Closely aligned with conservative, pro-Trump politics, these outlets emphasize Fed excesses while downplaying risks that political meddling poses to monetary stability, often using charged language to stir populist outrage.

- **Market-oriented financial press (e.g., The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Business, TheStreet)**: Treat the coming FOMC meeting as a technical, data-driven affair in which Powell will likely keep rates steady despite scattered internal calls for cuts, framing it mainly in terms of market expectations and investor implications. A markets-first lens can minimize the constitutional debate over Fed independence and cast policy as a betting game for traders, potentially muting criticism of either the Fed or the White House beyond their impact on asset prices.

- **Public broadcasting & mainstream national outlets critical of Trump pressure (e.g., NPR, NBC News, CBS News)**: Warn that Trump’s unprecedented, public brow-beating of Powell threatens the central bank’s independence and could rattle markets if he tries to fire the chair or strong-arm rate cuts. Coverage spotlighting institutional norms can tilt toward dramatizing Trump as uniquely hazardous, potentially glossing over legitimate critiques of past Fed missteps or broader debates about accountability.
