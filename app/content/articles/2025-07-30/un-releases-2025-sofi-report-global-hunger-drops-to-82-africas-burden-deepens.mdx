# UN Releases 2025 SOFI Report: Global Hunger Drops to 8.2 %, Africa’s Burden Deepens

The new State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report shows a second-straight annual fall in world hunger to 8.2 % in 2024, even as Africa’s share and absolute numbers continued to climb.

#### Focusing Facts

- SOFI puts 2024 undernourishment at 673 million people—down 15 million from 2023 and 22 million from 2022.

- Africa recorded 307 million hungry people (20 % of its population) in 2024 and is projected to hold nearly 60 % of the 512 million still hungry in 2030.

- Those unable to afford a healthy diet fell to 2.6 billion worldwide in 2024, but rose to 545 million in low-income countries, up 81 million since 2019.

#### Context

This update echoes past moments when commodity shocks reshaped food security—most notably the 1973–74 oil and fertilizer crunch that spurred the World Food Conference, and the 2007–08 price spike that ignited riots from Haiti to Mozambique.  Like those crises, the post-2020 ‘perfect storm’ of pandemic stimulus, the Russia-Ukraine war, and climate-driven weather extremes has distorted both prices and access more than sheer supply.  The data confirm a long-running pattern: every time global averages improve, structural fragilities—conflict, debt overhang, thin import bills—push Africa further behind, a divergence reminiscent of the 1980s debt crisis that locked many countries out of investment for a decade.  On a 100-year arc, the small 2024 gains may register as statistical noise unless they herald deeper shifts toward resilient, region-specific agrifood systems; otherwise, the world risks repeating the century-old cycle in which technological leaps raise output while unequal purchasing power keeps chronic hunger politically, not agriculturally, driven.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European public broadcasters (e.g., Deutsche Welle, RTL Today)**: Portray the SOFI report as evidence that hunger is worsening across Africa even while global averages dip, blaming conflict-driven instability and calling for debt relief and stronger international intervention. Emphasises humanitarian crises in Africa for a largely European audience, potentially glossing over improvements in other regions and framing solutions around Western aid and financial tools.

- **Chinese state-owned media (e.g., China Daily, People’s Daily)**: Underline the headline decline in global hunger and showcase policy successes in Asia, stressing that the world must act but that targeted measures are already delivering results. Highlights positive trends that align with Beijing’s narrative of effective governance and multilateral leadership, soft-pedalling criticisms of global inequities or China’s own responsibilities.

- **Environmental advocacy outlets (e.g., EcoWatch, Eco-Business)**: Frame the data through the lens of climate change and ecological degradation, warning that conflict and extreme weather are derailing progress and demanding systemic, sustainable agrifood reforms. Links almost every hunger trend to environmental factors and climate action agendas, which can understate economic policy dynamics or local governance issues that the data also highlight.
