# U.S.–China Stockholm Talks Set Up 90-Day Extension of Tariff Truce Pending Trump Sign-Off

After two days of negotiations in Stockholm on 28–29 July 2025, American and Chinese officials agreed in principle to prolong their May tariff pause past the 12 August deadline, handing the final go-ahead to President Donald Trump.

#### Focusing Facts

- Existing truce caps duties at 30 % on $300 bn of Chinese goods and 10 % on $120 bn of U.S. exports, rates that would revert to triple-digit levels if no decision is made by 12 Aug 2025.

- Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Beijing its roughly 2 million-barrel-per-day purchases of sanctioned Russian oil could trigger U.S. secondary tariffs of up to 100 % under pending legislation.

- Negotiators indicated the next bilateral meeting will occur in approximately 90 days, mirroring the length of the proposed extension.

#### Context

Like the 1953 Korean armistice, this ‘pause’ freezes hostilities without resolving root causes, forcing periodic cliff-edge renewals. It underscores two structural shifts: the United States’ routine use of tariffs as a geopolitical lever—an echo of the Smoot-Hawley era (1930) that splintered global trade—and China’s growing counter-leverage via critical inputs, akin to OPEC’s 1973 oil embargo that reordered supply chains. Whether Trump signs off or not, the episode signals a longer drift toward weaponised interdependence and club-based trading blocs which, on a 100-year horizon, could erode the post-1945 multilateral trade system and harden a bifurcated global economy.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Major Western wire and business press (Reuters, CNBC, Fortune, Quartz, Euronews)**: Reporters frame the Stockholm talks as cautiously constructive and suggest a tariff-truce extension is likely but ultimately hinges on President Trump’s personal approval. By foregrounding market reactions and Trump’s decision-making they cater to investor audiences and may underplay how China could still walk away or reshape the deal in its favour.

- **Left-leaning media (The Guardian)**: Coverage stresses that negotiators ‘failed to find resolution’ and highlights Trump’s combative tariff threats, depicting the pause as a fragile stop-gap rather than real progress. The focus on deadlock and Trump’s aggressiveness fits the publication’s critical stance toward his administration and could exaggerate the sense of impending chaos compared with more neutral accounts.

- **Russian state-owned media (TASS)**: Reports declare the United States and China have already agreed to extend tariff benefits for another three months, presenting the talks as a clear success. By announcing a done deal ahead of confirmation from U.S. officials, the outlet aligns with Moscow’s interest in portraying U.S. leverage as limited and Beijing as an effective negotiator.
