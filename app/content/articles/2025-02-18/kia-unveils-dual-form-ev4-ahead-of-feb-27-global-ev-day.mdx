# Kia Unveils Dual-Form EV4 Ahead of Feb 27 Global EV Day

Kia revealed early production images of its EV4, showcasing both sedan and hatchback versions with signature design cues ahead of its full debut on February 27, 2025 in Spain.

#### Focusing Facts

- Production-ready EV4 design unveiled on February 17, 2025, closely mirroring the 2023 concept.

- Offered in both sedan and hatchback forms with a distinctive 'Tiger Face' front, 19-inch alloy wheels, and available GT-Line trim.

- Built on Hyundai’s E-GMP platform with battery options of 58/81 kWh, promising a range of over 300 miles.

#### Context

Kia’s EV4 launch, revealing two body styles ahead of its global debut, mirrors past automotive strategies where diversified offerings expanded market appeal—much like the dual body types introduced by legacy automakers in the 1980s and 1990s. This move, characterized by the ‘Opposites United’ design philosophy, signals a long-term industry shift where brands balance heritage aesthetics with next-gen electric engineering. As with transformative releases such as the early compact cars that reshaped mobility, the EV4’s introduction is a marker in the evolution of mass-market EVs that could influence automotive design and consumer expectations well into the next century.
