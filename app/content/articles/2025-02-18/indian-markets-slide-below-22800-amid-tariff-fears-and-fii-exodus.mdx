# Indian Markets Slide Below 22,800 Amid Tariff Fears and FII Exodus

On February 17, 2025, major Indian indices including Nifty and Sensex declined sharply amid weak Q3 earnings, escalating tariff concerns by President Trump, and heavy foreign outflows, pushing key support levels into focus.

#### Focusing Facts

- Nifty 50 fell 674 points (-2.81%) on Feb 17, 2025, with technical charts indicating further downside risks below the 22,800 support zone.

- Foreign institutional investors have withdrawn over ₹1.09 trillion in 2025, with Rs 99,299 crore sold by mid-February adding to the market pressure.

- The Nifty Smallcap index dropped nearly 10% in one week, with 55 stocks hitting their 52-week lows amid liquidity tightening and stretched valuations.

#### Context

This market correction is reminiscent of past cyclical downturns such as the nine-session dip in 2019 and the rebound pattern from the March 2023 lows, where technical supports acted as a pivot point for recovery. However, today’s plunge—fueled by a mix of weak corporate earnings, elevated valuations, and fears over US-imposed reciprocal tariffs (with a final decision expected by April 2025)—underscores systemic vulnerabilities in emerging markets. Over a 100-year perspective, such episodes illustrate the recurring tension between global trade shocks and domestic market fundamentals, reminding investors that while historical rebound trends exist, prolonged sell-offs can lead to structural shifts in market valuation and investor confidence.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Tech-focused market optimists**: They emphasize that historical technical patterns and support levels suggest a high likelihood of a near-term rebound for Nifty after its recent correction. They may rely too heavily on technical analysis and historical trends while downplaying current fundamental risks like weak earnings and geopolitical tensions.

- **Fundamental bearish market analysts**: This group warns that persistent FII outflows, weak corporate earnings, and rising tariff concerns are likely to weigh on the market, prolonging the downturn. They might focus excessively on short-term negative news and macroeconomic headwinds, potentially exaggerating the market’s weakness in the immediate term.
