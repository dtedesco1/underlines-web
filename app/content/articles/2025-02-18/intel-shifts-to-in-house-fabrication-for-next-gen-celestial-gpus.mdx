# Intel Shifts to In-House Fabrication for Next-Gen 'Celestial' GPUs

Intel is set to launch its next-generation Celestial dGPUs featuring the enhanced Xe3P architecture produced in-house by Intel Foundry Services, departing from its previous reliance on TSMC.

#### Focusing Facts

- Celestial GPUs will adopt the Xe3P architecture, a development first noted on an Intel engineer’s LinkedIn profile on February 16, 2025.

- The production move from TSMC to Intel Foundry marks a strategic shift to in-house semiconductor manufacturing for these chips.

- Multiple sources indicate a release timeline around late 2025 to Q1 2026, post-Panther Lake.

#### Context

Intel’s decision to produce its Celestial GPUs using its own foundry echoes historical instances where firms controlled critical production processes—comparable to IBM’s 1980s strategic manufacturing moves. This shift could reshape long-established GPU supply dynamics, challenging incumbents like Nvidia and AMD by leveraging vertical integration to potentially reduce bottlenecks and boost innovation. Over a century-long view, such moves not only reflect ongoing technological and supply chain evolutions but also signal how reasserting domestic semiconductor capabilities may recalibrate global competitivity and resilience in critical tech sectors.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream tech media**: This group frames Intel's Celestial GPUs as a promising disruption that could intensify competition with established players like Nvidia and AMD, highlighting the potential advantages of an in-house manufacturing shift. They tend to lean into the excitement of a market shake-up and may overstate potential benefits despite the persistent uncertainties and reliance on leaked information.

- **Detailed hardware analysis outlets**: This group emphasizes the technical and manufacturing specifics of Intel's rumored Xe3P architecture and production changes, with a careful discussion of timelines and component details. Their focus on granular data and caution with rumors may lead to an underestimation of the broader market impact, often tempering optimism as details remain unconfirmed.
