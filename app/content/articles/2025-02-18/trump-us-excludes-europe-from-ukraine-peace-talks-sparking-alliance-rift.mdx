# Trump-U.S. Excludes Europe from Ukraine Peace Talks, Sparking Alliance Rift

In mid-February 2025, the Trump administration altered the Ukraine conflict strategy by initiating direct negotiations with Russia—marked by a 90‐minute Trump-Putin call and a new negotiating team—while systematically sidelining European allies from discussions.

#### Focusing Facts

- On February 12, 2025, President Trump held a 90-minute call with Putin and immediately set up a negotiating team excluding traditional figures like Keith Kellogg.

- US envoy Keith Kellogg announced that Europe would not be included in the peace talks, prompting emergency summits and troop deployment proposals by European leaders.

- UK Prime Minister Starmer declared readiness to deploy British troops to Ukraine and, alongside other European powers, convened summits in Paris to counter the US's negotiating approach.

#### Context

This reorientation recalls the Cold War era when the US recalibrated its global posture—as seen in Eisenhower’s troop withdrawals in the 1950s—in response to changing geopolitical realities. The Trump administration’s unilateral move to negotiate with Russia without European input challenges the post-World War II transatlantic consensus and raises long-term questions about collective security, alliance credibility, and the balance of power. Over a century, such strategic shifts could reshape international norms, potentially leading to a fragmented NATO and a redefined European security architecture.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning media**: They celebrate Trump’s decisive, unconventional diplomatic moves with Putin, criticizing European leadership for sustaining the war in Ukraine and arguing that sidelining European involvement is beneficial. This group often favors pro-Trump narratives that blame traditional allies for prolonging conflict while ignoring issues of democratic inclusiveness and alliance commitments.

- **Mainstream European/Liberal media**: They condemn Trump’s unilateral approach as divisive, warning that excluding Europe from peace talks undermines longstanding transatlantic alliances and jeopardizes Ukraine’s sovereignty. This perspective tends to emphasize institutional cooperation and shared values, sometimes overlooking the appeal of populist critiques or the complexity of shifting global priorities.
