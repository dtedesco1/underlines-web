# Zelenskyy Rejects Trump’s 50% Mineral Wealth Proposal

On February 15-17, 2025, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy decisively turned down a U.S. offer demanding 50% ownership of Ukraine's rare earth minerals in exchange for continued American military and financial aid.

#### Focusing Facts

- U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent presented the proposal in Kyiv, urging an immediate signature.

- The deal would have given the U.S. rights to half of Ukraine’s resources, including lithium, graphite, and uranium, without binding security guarantees.

- Zelenskyy is formulating a counterproposal, seeking broader European involvement and explicit security guarantees.

#### Context

This diplomatic standoff recalls historical resource and security bargains, such as the 1994 Budapest Memorandum in which Ukraine exchanged its nuclear arsenal for security assurances that later proved problematic, and even earlier Cold War-era negotiations over resource-rich states. Over the past century, leveraging natural assets as collateral in global power struggles has repeatedly tested national sovereignty versus external security pressures. While the Trump administration’s proposal echoes previous realpolitik maneuvers—like the 2017 coal deal—this moment is emblematic of longer-term trends where smaller nations must balance economic dependence with the preservation of national autonomy in a polarized, competitive international system.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: They view the proposal as an exploitative, colonial-style approach where the U.S. attempts to claim half of Ukraine’s mineral wealth without offering sufficient security guarantees or respect for Ukrainian sovereignty. This perspective tends to emphasize ethical and anti-imperialist criticisms, possibly downplaying the strategic or economic rationale behind such a deal.

- **Right leaning media**: They frame the proposal as a strategic economic opportunity that would help recoup U.S. investments in Ukraine and strengthen a mutually beneficial partnership, criticizing Zelenskyy's decision as short-sighted. This view may overstate the benefits of U.S.-Ukraine ties and focus on economic returns, potentially sidelining Ukraine’s concerns over sovereignty and security guarantees.
