# Xi Jinping Pivots to Renew Private Sector Confidence with High-Profile Meeting

On February 17, 2025, Xi Jinping hosted a major symposium at Beijing’s Great Hall to signal a policy turnaround toward boosting private business amid economic slowdown and external trade pressures.

#### Focusing Facts

- The meeting on Feb 17, 2025, at the Great Hall featured Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang, and top entrepreneurs including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, Huawei’s Ren Zhengfei, and BYD’s Wang Chuanfu.

- Xi delivered a speech promising support via financing measures and tax relief—a marked pivot from the severe regulatory crackdown initiated after Ma's 2020 Ant Group IPO cancellation.

- The session coincided with market responses, with Hong Kong indices initially rallying and state media framing the event as a course correction, echoing similar efforts in 2018 during heightened US-China trade tensions.

#### Context

This meeting echoes historical turning points such as the 2018 forum during escalating US-China trade frictions and, on a broader scale, Deng Xiaoping’s 1978 economic reforms that deftly balanced state control with market liberalization. In a long view, Beijing’s recalibration—shifting from punitive oversight to a promise of support for innovative private enterprises—reflects ongoing systemic debates over state versus market roles in China’s economic evolution. While the signal to rehabilitate figures like Jack Ma and reinvigorate private spending may stabilize near-term growth, its long-term impact on China’s 100-year trajectory will depend on maintaining this delicate balance amid global industrial rivalries and internal reform pressures.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western Business Media**: These outlets frame the meeting as a significant course correction, suggesting that Xi's engagement with private sector leaders signals renewed support for innovation and economic growth after a stringent regulatory crackdown. They often stress the dramatic pivot and may overstate the extent of change, potentially downplaying the continued impacts of state control and bureaucratic influence in the economy.

- **Local and Regional News Outlets**: This group presents the meeting as a routine, state-sanctioned effort to stabilize and boost the domestic economy amid slow growth and external pressures, emphasizing continuity in economic policy. They typically echo official narratives, offering little scrutiny of past regulatory crackdowns and serving state policy interests by highlighting economic stability over political nuance.
