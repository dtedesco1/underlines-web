# UBS Raises 2025 Gold Forecast as Tariff Fears and Gold Movements Escalate

In mid-February 2025, UBS revised its outlook, projecting gold to surpass $3,200 per ounce, amid record price surges and geopolitical tariff scares triggered by President Trump’s aggressive trade policies.

#### Focusing Facts

- UBS updated its forecast on February 17, 2025, boosting the anticipated gold peak to over $3,200 per ounce from its earlier estimate.

- Gold prices have surged to around $2,900 per ounce in early 2025 with record highs achieved in just six weeks, while traders report transatlantic bullion transfers (about 8,000 bars) from London to New York as tariff fears loom.

- Central banks have ramped up physical gold demand and leasing activities, with data showing over 1,000 tonnes purchased last year and significant collateral shifts amid politically driven market maneuvers.

#### Context

This surge echoes historical gold rushes such as the post-Nixon era in 1971 when market forces clashed with governmental controls to preserve the dollar’s dominance. The current scenario—fueled by record price trends, aggressive US tariff policies, and swift physical gold movements—reflects a longstanding shift where geopolitics and monetary policies interlace, disrupting not only the futures market but also the physical supply chain. Over nearly a century, gold has served as both a safe haven and a lever of financial power, and today’s volatile landscape may presage a broader transformation in how central banks and investors perceive the balance between fiat currencies and tangible assets, with implications that could reshape global financial structures over the next 100 years.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream Financial Media**: These sources interpret gold’s surge as a direct response to heightened geopolitical tensions, tariff threats by President Trump, and increased central bank buying, positioning gold as a safe-haven amid global trade uncertainties. Their analysis may overemphasize government actions and short-term political developments while overlooking underlying market fundamentals.

- **Alternative Economic Skeptics**: This camp argues that the gold market is being manipulated through tactics like short selling and rehypothecation, suggesting deeper systemic vulnerabilities and potential financial collapse driven by government and central bank policies. Their narrative can be influenced by a conspiratorial outlook that sometimes exaggerates manipulation to criticize established financial institutions.

- **Investment-Trader Analysts**: These articles focus on technical market analysis and investment strategies, comparing gold’s performance with assets like Bitcoin and emphasizing the potential for trades and portfolio diversification amid volatile conditions. They may prioritize short-term trading opportunities over a broader economic perspective, and their recommendations could be driven by market momentum rather than long-term fundamentals.
