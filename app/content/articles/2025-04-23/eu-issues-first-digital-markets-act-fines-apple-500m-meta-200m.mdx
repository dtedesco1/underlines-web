# EU Issues First Digital Markets Act Fines: Apple €500m, Meta €200m

On 23 April 2025 Brussels used the one‑year‑old Digital Markets Act for the first time, slapping Apple and Meta with a combined €700 million for anti‑steering and “consent‑or‑pay” practices, shifting the law from theory to enforcement.

#### Focusing Facts

- Apple was fined €500 million for blocking App‑Store developers from directing users to cheaper external payment options.

- Meta was fined €200 million for forcing EU users to either accept personalised‑ad tracking across services or pay a subscription.

- Both companies have 60 days to overhaul the disputed practices or face additional penalties that can reach 10 % of global revenue.

#### Context

Europe’s move echoes the U.S. Justice Department’s 1998 suit that cracked Microsoft’s bundling power, but with a trans‑Atlantic reversal: now Washington bristles while Brussels wields antitrust muscle.  The DMA signals a structural trend—nation‑states reasserting regulatory sovereignty over borderless platforms, much as 19th‑century rail barons were eventually curbed by the 1887 Interstate Commerce Act.  Whether these mid‑sized fines bite is less important than the precedent: once the rulebook is proven enforceable, trillion‑dollar firms must treat policy risk like currency or oil majors treat reserve risk.  On a 100‑year horizon this is another step in the long cycle of concentrating private networks and periodic public push‑back; if the EU sustains enforcement, it could evolve into a global template, but if politics or trade retaliation neuter it, the moment will read as a brief flare rather than a hinge in digital governance.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European policy‑focused outlets (e.g., Reuters)**: Frame the penalties as the EU’s first tough but even‑handed application of the Digital Markets Act meant to protect consumers and level the playing field for smaller rivals. By highlighting Ursula von der Leyen’s claim that Brussels "doesn’t care where a company’s from" these reports under‑state how the crackdown simultaneously strengthens Europe’s bargaining power in an ongoing trade spat with Washington. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/eu-says-it-will-enforce-digital-rules-irrespective-ceo-location-2025-04-21/), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-fined-570-million-meta-228-million-breaching-eu-law-2025-04-23/))

- **Mainstream U.S. news outlets (e.g., The New York Times, Associated Press)**: Present the fines chiefly as another flash‑point in a widening EU‑U.S. trade confrontation, noting President Trump’s threat of retaliation and Meta’s complaint of an "attack on American companies." Centering the narrative on U.S. political fallout and the firms’ grievances risks downplaying European consumer‑protection arguments that receive only brief mention. ([The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/technology/apple-meta-eu-fines-competition-law.html), [U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2025-04-23/the-european-union-fines-apple-500-million-euros-and-meta-200-million-in-separate-digital-cases))

- **Investor‑oriented business media (e.g., CityAM, Proactiveinvestors)**: Stress the financial impact and corporate push‑back, echoing Apple’s and Meta’s assertions that Brussels is "unfairly targeting" them and imposing a de‑facto "multi‑billion‑dollar tariff." By foregrounding quotes about damage to share‑holders and competitive disadvantage, these reports largely adopt the companies’ rhetorical framing while giving scant space to the EU’s rationale or consumer benefits.
