# Chinese Airlines Begin Flying Undelivered Boeing 737 MAX Jets Back to the U.S. After 125% Tariffs

For the first time since deliveries resumed in 2024, Chinese carriers physically ferried newly built 737 MAX aircraft back to Seattle rather than accept them, immediately after April 2025 tariff hikes made each jet roughly double in cost.

#### Focusing Facts

- On 20 Apr 2025 a Xiamen‑liveried 737 MAX landed at Boeing Field, Seattle, after a 5,000‑mile ferry flight from Zhoushan via Guam and Hawaii.

- This followed Donald Trump’s April move raising U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, met by Beijing’s 125% duty on U.S. imports, including aircraft.

- Boeing’s order book still lists 130 aircraft awaiting delivery to Chinese customers as of 31 Mar 2025.

#### Context

Aerospace had enjoyed de‑facto duty‑free status since the 1944 Chicago Convention, surviving even the 1987 U.S.–Japan semiconductor tariff battle, but the new levies echo the 1930 Smoot‑Hawley moment when protectionism spilled across industries. The forced return of finished jets signals how strategic sectors are being weaponised in the wider de‑globalisation trend that has already hit chips, rare earths and EVs. If sustained, the rupture could accelerate China’s pivot to home‑grown COMAC jets and entrench Airbus’s lead, much as British aircraft firms lost ground after post‑war currency crises. On a century scale this episode may mark the inflection where the U.S.–China aerospace symbiosis—once a pillar of Boeing’s dominance—began to unravel, reshaping global aviation supply chains far beyond this week’s headline flight.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning Western media (e.g., The Guardian, The Express Tribune)**: They frame the 737 MAX’s return as a direct casualty of President Trump’s aggressive tariff policy, portraying Boeing as a victim of Washington‑driven trade escalation. Focusing blame on the White House lets Beijing’s own trade tactics and earlier safety disputes fade into the background, reinforcing a narrative long critical of Republican economic nationalism.

- **Right leaning U.S. media (e.g., Fox Business)**: Coverage stresses that China ordered airlines to halt Boeing deliveries and slapped steep duties, casting Beijing’s retaliation as the prime threat to U.S. jobs and exporters. By centering Chinese actions and quoting Republican lawmakers, the reporting minimizes the role U.S. tariffs played in provoking the standoff, aligning with a hawkish stance toward China.

- **Asian business press (e.g., Bangkok Post, Mint, WION)**: Reports present the episode largely as a numbers‑driven business decision—Chinese carriers deem the jet ‘too expensive’ under 125 % duties—while stressing Boeing’s reliance on the Chinese market. This cost‑centric framing plays down the political brinkmanship behind the tariffs and may reflect regional interest in stable Sino‑U.S. commerce rather than assigning clear fault.
