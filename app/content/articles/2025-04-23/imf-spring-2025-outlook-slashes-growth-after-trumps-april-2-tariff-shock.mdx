# IMF Spring 2025 Outlook Slashes Growth After Trump’s April 2 Tariff Shock

In its hastily‑revised World Economic Outlook, the IMF cut 2025 global growth to 2.8% and the U.S. to 1.8%—downgrades of 0.5 and 0.9 percentage points—explicitly attributing the slide to President Trump’s April 2 blanket and China‑specific tariffs.

#### Focusing Facts

- U.S. real GDP is now projected to rise just 1.8% in 2025, versus 2.7% forecast in January—a 0.9‑point reduction.

- The global growth estimate was lowered to 2.8% for 2025, 0.5‑point below the prior 3.3% call.

- Trump’s April 2 order imposed a uniform 10% tariff on most imports and up to 145% on Chinese goods, the steepest U.S. trade barriers since the 1930 Smoot‑Hawley Act.

#### Context

A sharp tariff spike forcing the IMF to re‑run its models in ten days echoes the scramble after the June 1930 Smoot‑Hawley Act, which preceded a 45% plunge in world trade by 1933.  Like the 1971 Nixon surcharge or the 2018–19 tariff skirmishes, this episode signals another turn away from the post‑1947 GATT/​WTO order toward fragmented ‘friend‑shoring’.  Over a century‑scale lens the moment matters because compounding micro‑shocks—pandemics, wars, climate stress—are colliding with deliberate policy fragmentation, threatening the efficiency gains that underpinned the 1945‑2020 hyper‑globalisation cycle.  If today’s tariffs persist, the IMF’s projected 3.2% five‑year ceiling would mark the slowest medium‑term expansion since World War II, hinting that the rules‑based trade system that lifted billions may be giving way to a more regional, politically driven architecture.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: Portrays Trump’s sweeping tariffs as a "major negative shock" that will hobble global and U.S. growth and urges de‑escalation of the trade war. Their progressive framing spotlights the harms of nationalist economics while giving little airtime to the administration’s claim that tariffs protect American jobs.

- **Business‑focused financial outlets**: Stresses the IMF’s downgraded forecasts and warns investors that tariff‑driven uncertainty is pressuring markets, inflation, and central‑bank policy. A market‑centric perspective can magnify downside risk because headlines that heighten trader anxiety tend to attract their core readership of investors.

- **UK national news organisations**: Emphasises that although tariffs will hurt, the UK is still projected to outgrow European peers while cautioning that domestic inflation will spike. By foregrounding relative UK strength and quoting government figures, the coverage softens the broader global gloom and echoes Westminster talking points.
