# FDA/HHS Orders U.S. Food Makers to Drop Eight Petroleum‑Based Dyes by 2026

On 22 April 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary ordered industry to reformulate products to eliminate the last eight FDA‑approved petroleum food colorants within two years.

#### Focusing Facts

- The mandate targets Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Orange B and the already‑restricted Red 3, covering an estimated 300,000 U.S. packaged goods.

- Companies must remove the dyes from foods by 31 Dec 2026 (drugs get an extra year for Red 3), accelerating the Biden‑era Red 3 phase‑out that had allowed until 2027–28.

- Synthetic dye consumption per American has risen five‑fold since 1955, with Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 accounting for 90 % of use, according to FDA figures cited at the briefing.

#### Context

The United States is replaying an old regulatory cycle: Theodore Roosevelt’s 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act clamped down on coal‑tar dyes, and the 1938 FD&C Act formalised colour listings; today’s petroleum dyes face the same fate that befell trans‑fats in 2015 and saccharin warnings in 1977.  Globally, Europe’s 2009 "Southampton Six" restrictions and the U.K.’s 2008 voluntary withdrawal pushed multinationals to develop natural formulations years ago, so the U.S. move largely forces domestic parity rather than genuine innovation.  It also reflects deeper currents—consumer skepticism of ultra‑processed foods, state‑level activism (California 2023, West Virginia 2025), and a partisan turn toward populist public‑health crusades.  Whether banning cosmetic additives dents America’s 60 % chronic‐disease prevalence is doubtful, but it signals a regulatory pendulum swinging back from decades of GRAS liberalism toward a precautionary ethos that could, over the century, redefine the acceptable chemical footprint of mass‑produced food.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right‑leaning media (e.g., Fox News, The Daily Wire)**: Frame the Trump administration’s dye ban as a decisive, child‑protecting victory that will rid the food system of ‘poison’ and advance the ‘Make America Healthy Again’ agenda. Their coverage closely aligns with Trump‑era political branding and amplifies worst‑case health claims, giving little space to cost concerns or studies that find dyes safe within limits.

- **Mainstream U.S. business and health outlets (e.g., CNBC, NBC News, Yahoo)**: Report the planned phase‑out while stressing that current FDA assessments find limited or inconclusive evidence of harm, quoting experts who note acceptable daily intake levels and industry cost worries. By foregrounding regulatory uncertainty and economic impacts, these outlets may underplay potential public‑health benefits and implicitly echo food‑industry talking points.

- **British public broadcaster (BBC)**: Presents the U.S. action as long‑overdue, noting Europe phased out similar dyes years ago and highlighting studies linking them to behavioral and cancer risks. Emphasizing that the U.S. is ‘catching up’ allows the outlet to underline European regulatory leadership, potentially overstating the scientific consensus on harm.
