# Pope Francis Lies in State; Funeral Fixed for 26 April at St Peter’s

On 23 April the Vatican moved Francis’ coffin from Casa Santa Marta to St Peter’s Basilica for a three‑day public viewing and confirmed his funeral will take place at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, 26 April 2025.

#### Focusing Facts

- The procession began at 09:00 Rome time on 23 April, after which the basilica will stay open until 19:00 on 25 April for mourners.

- Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91, will preside over the outdoor requiem Mass in St Peter’s Square on 26 April.

- Italy expects 150‑170 foreign delegations; attendees include President Donald Trump, President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Prince William.

#### Context

Papally choreographed funerals are centuries‑old theatre; the last comparable moment was John Paul II’s 2005 rites that drew 200 heads of state, while the abrupt 33‑day pontificate of John Paul I in 1978 showed how funerals can reset the Church’s direction. Francis’ choice of a single wooden coffin and burial in Santa Maria Maggiore – first pope since Leo XIII (d.1903) interred outside the Vatican – extends his 12‑year campaign against clerical grandeur and toward decentralisation. More broadly, the event underscores a long arc: the papacy’s shift from European court to global moral platform, now attracting presidents who often sparred with Francis on migration, climate, and war. Whether the conclave continues his Global‑South tilt or reverts toward an Italian centre will shape Catholic influence well into the twenty‑second century; yet the simplified rites themselves signal an irreversible cultural expectation of institutional humility.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (The Guardian, The New York Times)**: Cast Pope Francis’s funeral as the culmination of a reform‑minded papacy, stressing his humble burial wishes and lifelong focus on the poor, migrants and the planet. By foregrounding the progressive legacy they admire, these outlets gloss over doctrinal disputes and resistance from conservative Catholics that complicated his tenure. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/pilgrims-begin-to-gather-as-pope-francis-set-to-lie-in-state-at-st-peters-basilica), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/world/europe/pope-francis-funeral.html))

- **Right leaning media (Fox News)**: Frames the event chiefly as an elaborate Catholic ritual and major geopolitical gathering, detailing the procession, liturgy and attendance of figures like Donald Trump. The focus on ceremony and state pageantry soft‑pedals Francis’s more liberal stances and past clashes with conservatives, aligning coverage with the preferences of its right‑of‑center audience.

- **Italian local news (ANSA.it)**: Reports the funeral in meticulous logistical terms, highlighting procession routes, security operations and Italy’s five‑day national mourning decree. A domestic lens accentuates Italy’s organisational role and national sentiment, leaving broader theological or global political interpretations largely untouched.
