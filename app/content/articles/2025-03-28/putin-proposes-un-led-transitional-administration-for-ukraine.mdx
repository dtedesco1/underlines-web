# Putin Proposes UN-Led Transitional Administration for Ukraine

On March 28, 2025, Putin proposed placing Ukraine under a temporary, internationally managed administration to hold new elections and pave the way for peace talks, explicitly questioning the legitimacy of the current government post-Zelensky’s mandate.

#### Focusing Facts

- Putin made the proposal during his visit to Murmansk on March 28, 2025.

- He argued that Ukraine’s current leadership lost legitimacy after the expected May 2024 elections were deferred due to wartime conditions.

- Simultaneously, U.S. and European initiatives, including ceasefire talks in the Black Sea and a proposed minerals deal, highlight a complex negotiation landscape.

#### Context

This proposal echoes historical precedents such as UN-administered transitions in East Timor (1999) and parts of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, where international oversight was used to stabilize regions after conflict. It reflects a long-term pattern of major powers using transitional governance as both a peace-building mechanism and a strategic lever in diplomatic negotiations. Although intended as a pathway to peace, such maneuvers can also be seen as part of ongoing power struggles that have shaped geopolitical realignments over the last century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream International Media**: They report Putin’s proposal of a temporary administration in Ukraine as a potential pathway to a negotiated settlement that includes democratic elections, noting that leaders like Trump are seen as sincere peace-seekers. Their coverage tends to frame the proposal in line with official statements and may inadvertently legitimize Putin’s narrative by focusing on negotiated solutions without fully critiquing its underlying motive to delegitimize Ukraine’s current government.

- **Ukrainian Critical Media**: This group dismisses the idea as a maneuver to undermine Ukraine’s legitimate government by delegitimizing President Zelensky’s authority and distracting from ongoing conflict and attacks. Their presentation is highly skeptical of any proposals emanating from Putin and is predisposed to view such gestures as mere stalling tactics aimed at justifying further military actions.
