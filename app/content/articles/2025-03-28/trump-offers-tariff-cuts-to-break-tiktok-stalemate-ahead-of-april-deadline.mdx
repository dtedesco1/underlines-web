# Trump Offers Tariff Cuts to Break TikTok Stalemate Ahead of April Deadline

Amid an impending April 5, 2025 deadline to divest TikTok’s U.S. operations, President Trump signaled a willingness to reduce tariffs on China to foster an approval from Beijing for a divestiture deal.

#### Focusing Facts

- TikTok’s parent ByteDance must sell U.S. operations to a non-Chinese buyer by April 5, 2025 under a 2024 national security law.

- Tariffs on Chinese imports were raised to 20%, and Trump has repeatedly hinted at reducing them to leverage a favorable TikTok deal.

- Senators warned that failure to comply could expose firms like Apple and Google to liabilities up to $850 billion.

#### Context

This event epitomizes the fusion of trade policy and national security in the ongoing U.S.-China rivalry. Much like the 1981 trade disputes where President Reagan used tariff threats against Japanese automobiles to secure market concessions, Trump's proposal to lessen tariffs in exchange for a TikTok divestiture reflects an enduring strategy of economic coercion. Over decades, U.S. policymakers have incrementally expanded controls over foreign tech under the banner of national security—a trend that now forces digital platforms into the political arena. Whether this move will set a long-term precedent for tech governance or merely be a strategic bargaining chip remains to be seen, but its implications may well ripple across global trade and regulatory frameworks for the next 100 years.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream US Media Reporting**: They report Trump's proposal to reduce tariffs as a pragmatic negotiation strategy to secure a deal that prevents a TikTok ban, emphasizing national security concerns and diplomatic pressure on China. This perspective may underplay the deeper political or strategic implications of granting concessions to China and tends to present the administration’s statements in a straightforward, uncritical manner.

- **Tech Industry and Legal Analysts**: They focus on the risks associated with extending the TikTok negotiation deadline and the potential legal liabilities for US tech companies, questioning the viability and legality of Trump’s approach. This view may overemphasize the potential downsides and legal uncertainties, prioritizing risk assessment over the political and national security rationale behind the decision.
