# First Gene-Edited Pig Liver Bridges 10-Day Xenotransplant Milestone

On March 10, 2024, Chinese researchers at Xijing Hospital successfully transplanted a gene-modified pig liver into a brain-dead human, maintaining organ function for 10 days.

#### Focusing Facts

- The xenograft, from a Bama miniature pig with six gene edits, produced bile and porcine albumin and maintained stable blood flow within two hours post-transplant.

- The procedure was performed under a strict research protocol at Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University in China, with the study terminated on day 10 at the family's request.

- The study, published in Nature on March 26, 2025, builds on previous xenotransplant successes including pig kidney and heart trials in humans and primates.

#### Context

This breakthrough recalls early high-risk transplant experiments, such as the first human liver transplant in 1967 and pioneering pig-to-primate studies in the 1990s, showing how decades of innovation and the advent of gene-editing have gradually mitigated immunological barriers. While the 10-day functional period in a brain-dead recipient doesn’t herald immediate clinical application, it represents a significant step in the long-term quest to address organ shortages—a pursuit that, over the past 100 years, has steadily transformed from experimental surgery into standardized practice. As with past incremental advances, today’s achievement reflects both a new capability in genetic modification and the enduring complexities of immune compatibility, setting the stage for future refinements in bridge therapy for liver failure patients.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Technical Medical Outlets**: They present the pig-to-human liver xenotransplantation as a significant, carefully monitored scientific milestone that offers valuable clinical data and future potential to bridge the organ shortage gap. Their detailed focus on physiological metrics and immunological data may underplay broader ethical concerns and long-term clinical challenges.

- **Popular Tech and Science Media**: They frame the transplant as a groundbreaking achievement that highlights a promising future in organ replacement technology and medical innovation. Their enthusiastic narrative can oversimplify complex medical challenges and may amplify the breakthrough without sufficient emphasis on potential limitations.
