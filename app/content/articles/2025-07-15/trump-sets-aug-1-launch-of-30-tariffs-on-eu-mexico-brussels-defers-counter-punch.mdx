# Trump Sets Aug. 1 Launch of 30 % Tariffs on EU & Mexico; Brussels Defers Counter-Punch

On 12 July 2025, President Trump formally notified Brussels and Mexico City that a blanket 30 % duty on their exports will apply from 1 August, prompting the EU to postpone its own €21 bn retaliation until early August while scrambling for a negotiated reprieve.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump’s Truth-Social letters dated 12 July 2025 set a 30 % tariff effective 1 August and warned any EU or Mexican counter-tariff would be “added on” to that base rate.

- European Parliament’s 11 July vote to censure Commission President Ursula von der Leyen failed 360-175, ensuring the same leadership will steer the EU response.

- The EU’s planned counter-tariff list—covering €21 billion of U.S. goods—has been suspended twice (March and 13 July) and is now shelved until “early August.”

#### Context

Blanket tariffs of this scale recall the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act that deepened the Great Depression and, more recently, Trump’s 2018 steel–aluminium duties that triggered measured EU retaliation but ultimately shaved roughly 0.1 % from global GDP (OECD 2019). This episode fits a longer arc: the post-1995 WTO rules have weakened as large economies increasingly use national-security justifications to bypass multilateral discipline—first under Bush (2002 steel), then Obama (2014 solar safeguards), and now Trump’s even broader demands. Internally, the EU faces the same centrifugal forces that hobbled a unified response during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 vaccine scramble; every delay signals difficulty reconciling French calls for confrontation with German industrial dependence on U.S. demand. Over a century horizon, the moment matters less for the immediate duty rates than for how it normalizes tariff brinkmanship among advanced allies, accelerating the fragmentation of supply chains into politicized blocs—a reversal of the trade-liberalizing trajectory that underpinned Western economic integration from the 1957 Treaty of Rome through the 1994 creation of the WTO.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning U.S. media (e.g., Fox Business)**: Presents Trump’s 30% tariffs on Mexico and the EU as a firm, justified move to curb trade deficits and protect national security, echoing the president’s warnings that any retaliation will be met in kind. Highlights Trump’s rationale while glossing over likely consumer price hikes and global economic fallout, reflecting an incentive to reinforce a tough-on-trade image popular with conservative audiences.

- **European progressive and pro-EU outlets (e.g., The Guardian, EurActiv)**: Frame the tariffs as an aggressive provocation that threatens a damaging transatlantic trade war, urging the EU to prepare robust countermeasures while stressing unity among member states. Focuses on U.S. belligerence and potential European hardship but gives limited scrutiny to the EU’s own protectionist practices, mirroring a preference for defending the European project and free-trade norms. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/13/macron-calls-on-eu-to-defend-european-interests-resolutely-from-trump-tariffs), [EurActiv.com](https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/a-slap-in-the-face-eu-leaders-industry-reel-from-trumps-tariff-shock/))

- **International business wires and financial news (e.g., Reuters, CNBC)**: Report the tariff threat chiefly in terms of official statements and negotiation timelines, underscoring that both sides still aim for a deal before Aug 1 while noting the possibility of proportionate EU countermeasures. By centering on market impact and diplomatic process, these outlets project neutrality but tend to underplay power politics and social consequences, aligning with an audience focused on stability and investor confidence.
