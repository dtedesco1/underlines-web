# Trump Endorses NATO-Funded Pass-Through Scheme for U.S. Arms to Ukraine

President Trump has green-lit a new mechanism where NATO governments buy U.S. weapons outright—letting him claim no direct aid while Kyiv still receives the arms.

#### Focusing Facts

- During an NBC interview on 11 July 2025, Trump said “NATO is paying for those weapons, 100 percent,” outlining that U.S. arms will be sold to allies before transfer to Ukraine.

- The scheme grew out of the June 2025 NATO summit in The Hague, where 31 of 32 members (Spain abstained) also committed to lift defense budgets to 5 % of GDP within ten years.

- Trump vowed a "major statement" on Russia for 14 July 2025 as Congress weighs a bill to impose a 500 % tariff on importers of Russian oil.

#### Context

Washington last used a similar legal fiction in 1940–41 with the Cash-and-Carry clauses and later Lend-Lease, selling matériel to Britain to skirt neutrality laws until Pearl Harbor ended the pretence.  Today’s workaround signals a broader trend: the United States is trying to convert its post-1945 primacy into a pay-as-you-go security service while repositioning forces toward Asia.  Europe’s promise to spend 5 % of GDP echoes the rearmament push of the early 1950s but, as then, production lines and political cohesion may lag.  If the U.S. ultimately draws down troops, the plan could either accelerate long-overdue European self-reliance or leave a power vacuum for a revanchist Russia—an inflection point whose consequences, like the 1947 British withdrawal east of Suez, may reverberate for decades.  In the century view, this moment tests whether the Atlantic alliance can outgrow dependency on a single hegemon or merely mask it with accounting tricks.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning mainstream media**: They report that Trump’s plan lets NATO members pay for U.S. weapons that are then transferred to Kyiv, portraying it as a scheme that enriches Washington while insulating a skeptical president from direct responsibility for the war. By stressing the potential “financial windfall” and Trump’s efforts to avoid blame, their coverage implicitly questions his motives and foregrounds doubts about U.S. commitment, themes consistent with outlets often critical of the administration. ([The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/world/europe/trump-nato-weapons-ukraine.html), [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-putin-russia-maternity-ward-strike-b2787389.html))

- **Right-leaning pro-Trump media**: They celebrate the NATO-purchase plan as evidence that Trump is getting tough on Moscow and forcing allies to shoulder the cost, hinting at looming ‘major’ actions and a more aggressive U.S. stance in support of Ukraine. By casting the move as bold leadership and focusing on dramatic quotes like “You’ll be seeing things happen,” these outlets hype Trump’s decisiveness while glossing over logistical, legal, and escalation risks highlighted elsewhere.

- **Non-interventionist conservative commentators**: They argue that even with the current pause in shipments, the U.S. is locking itself into a costly, open-ended commitment to maintain Ukraine’s U.S.-made arsenal and remains over-extended in Europe. Emphasising sustainment headaches and nuclear-war risks, this perspective downplays Ukraine’s security needs and mirrors a broader preference for retrenchment that may understate the strategic consequences of a U.S. pullback.
