# Macron Accelerates Doubling of French Defense Budget to €64 bn by 2027

Pulling his 2030 goal forward, President Emmanuel Macron pledged on 13 July 2025 to hit €64 billion in annual military spending by 2027, adding €6.5 billion in the next two years despite France’s budget squeeze.

#### Focusing Facts

- Budget will jump from €50.5 bn in 2025 to €64 bn in 2027, a 27% rise in 24 months.

- Immediate top-ups: €3.5 bn extra in 2026 and another €3 bn in 2027 were announced in the Bastille-eve speech.

- NATO members agreed on 5 %-of-GDP defence spending target in June 2025, pressuring France (currently ~2.3 %) to scale up.

#### Context

France last raced to rearm this quickly in the mid-1930s, when Léon Blum’s Popular Front boosted defence outlays from 14 bn to 31 bn francs between 1936-38 amid Nazi expansion—too late to deter war. Macron’s 2025 acceleration similarly responds to a power vacuum as U.S. commitment wobbles and Russia prosecutes a grinding war in Ukraine. The move fits a 30-year reversal of Europe’s post-Cold-War "peace-dividend": after shrinking from 3-4 % of GDP in the early 1990s to under 2 % by 2014, spending is climbing again toward Cold-War levels. Whether this inflection becomes a 100-year pivot depends on two structural tensions: France’s debt burden (interest already €62 bn/year) and Europe’s ability to convert budgets into credible, interoperable capabilities—problems that have dogged EU defence integration since the failed 1954 European Defence Community. If sustained, the shift could mark Europe’s first truly autonomous military posture since De Gaulle pulled France from NATO’s integrated command in 1966; if fiscal or political will falters, it may prove another episodic surge like post-9/11 buildups that quickly receded.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European mainstream press (e.g., BBC, The Telegraph, POLITICO)**: Portrays Macron’s accelerated military build-up as a necessary response to Russia’s ‘durable’ threat and wavering U.S. support, framing the move as vital for safeguarding Europe’s freedom. Echoes NATO governments’ security narrative, potentially overstating imminent danger while giving little space to critics worried about social-spending trade-offs.

- **Business-oriented outlets (e.g., Business Standard, Reuters via U.S. News & World Report)**: Highlight the €6.5 billion surge and doubling to €64 billion by 2027 but stress France’s debt load and the political fight over financing the plan. Fiscal lens may underplay strategic threats and amplify deficit anxieties that resonate with investors and austerity advocates.

- **Global South regional media (e.g., Malay Mail, Pakistan Today)**: Frames the announcement as Europe scrambling to cope with a ‘menacing Russia’ and possible U.S. disengagement, presenting the speech as part of a broader collapse of the world order. Detached, outsider tone can accentuate Western insecurity narratives while sidestepping their own region’s stakes, giving the story a somewhat voyeuristic slant.
