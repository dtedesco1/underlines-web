# Meta Unveils $100-Billion-Plus Plan for Prometheus (2026) and 5-GW Hyperion AI Superclusters

Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta will pour “hundreds of billions of dollars” into building multi-gigawatt AI data-center clusters—starting with the 1-GW Prometheus site in Ohio coming online in 2026 and a 5-GW Hyperion complex in Louisiana by 2030.

#### Focusing Facts

- Prometheus, Meta’s first AI supercluster, is slated to reach 1 GW of compute power and begin operation in New Albany, Ohio in 2026.

- Hyperion, under construction in Louisiana, is designed to scale up to 5 GW—roughly the output of five nuclear reactors—and be fully online by 2030.

- Meta has already lured at least 11 senior AI scientists with compensation packages reportedly as high as ₹1,600 crore (≈US$190 million) tied to its new Superintelligence Lab.

#### Context

Silicon Valley hasn’t attempted an infrastructure leap of this magnitude since Google’s 2006–2010 push to blanket the globe with hyperscale data centers, and one must look back to the 1951-built UNIVAC or even the 1942-45 Manhattan Project to find comparably concentrated bets on a single technological vector.  The announcement accelerates two long-running trends: (1) compute and energy requirements for frontier AI are rising super-exponentially, echoing the way steel and electricity consumption ballooned during the 2nd Industrial Revolution, and (2) formerly ‘open’ platforms are drifting toward proprietary control once real economic rents appear, just as ARPANET research turned into the privatized Internet backbone in the 1990s.  If Meta succeeds, it could lock in a capital moat that deters smaller players and nudges global AI toward an energy-hungry, closed-model oligopoly; if it fails, the episode may resemble Xerox PARC’s 1970s spending spree—brilliant but commercially stranded.  On a 100-year horizon, the move matters less for its immediate market share than for cementing the precedent that AI progress is limited not by algorithms but by gigawatts, water rights, and geopolitical access to power grids.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business and investor-focused media (e.g., CNBC, Fast Company)**: They frame Meta’s multi-gigawatt data-center buildout as a bold, capital-backed strategy to leapfrog rivals in the AI arms race and deliver ‘industry-leading’ compute capacity. By spotlighting growth prospects and competitive positioning, they largely downplay or omit the project’s environmental costs, echoing company talking points attractive to investors and advertisers.

- **Outlets highlighting environmental and community impacts (e.g., BBC, MediaPost)**: They stress that Meta’s proposed clusters will guzzle unprecedented amounts of electricity and water, warning of possible ‘devastating effects’ on surrounding communities. Focusing on worst-case resource-use figures can overshadow potential efficiency gains or economic benefits, appealing to audiences concerned about Big Tech’s ecological footprint.

- **Tech industry critics worried about openness (e.g., TechCrunch)**: They interpret the spending spree as evidence Meta may shelve its open-source Behemoth model and pivot to closed systems, signalling openness was a strategic façade rather than a principle. Relying on unnamed sources and framing internal debate as a likely shift risks overstating the certainty of a move that Meta says is still undecided, matching the audience’s pro-open-source leanings.
