# US-China London Framework Sets Path to Resume Rare-Earth Trade

On 11 June 2025 negotiators in London struck a provisional deal exchanging quicker Chinese rare-earth exports for a partial U.S. rollback of new tech export controls, reviving the stalled May Geneva truce pending Xi and Trump approval.

#### Focusing Facts

- The handshake accord was reached after two straight days of talks at Lancaster House and requires sign-off from both presidents, expected as early as 11 June 2025, per Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

- China supplied about 70 % of global rare-earth mine output in 2024, leverage that underpinned the U.S. concession on export controls.

- The May Geneva détente had created a 90-day tariff reduction window that both sides accused each other of breaching within weeks.

#### Context

The episode recalls China’s 2010 rare-earth embargo on Japan (shipments dropped 40 % that year) and the 1973 OPEC oil shock—resource chokepoints wielded as geopolitical weapons. It highlights a long-running drift from tariff spats (2018–20) toward weaponised supply chains and export-control diplomacy, eroding the post-1949 U.S. norm that security controls are non-negotiable. Whether this moment proves pivotal or merely another loop in an escalating cycle will hinge on how fast the U.S. and its allies diversify critical-mineral supply and how far Beijing is willing to monetise its monopoly. On a century timeline, the London framework may be remembered less for the truce itself than for signalling a transition from interdependence to strategic self-sufficiency in the global tech-materials nexus.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Chinese state-run media (e.g., China Daily, People’s Daily, Xinhua/CGTN)**: The London talks show that cooperation is mutually beneficial, the U.S. must live up to its word, and China is committed to win-win trade while standing firm against pressure. By portraying Beijing as both reasonable and resolute while painting Washington as the unreliable actor, these outlets defend government policy and deflect blame for any future breakdown in talks.

- **Right-leaning U.S. media (e.g., Fox Business, CNBC)**: Presents the framework as a concrete achievement for the Trump administration that will soon resolve U.S. concerns over rare-earth supplies and move the Geneva consensus toward implementation once the presidents approve it. Coverage spotlights Trump officials’ optimism and omits sceptics, amplifying the White House narrative of progress while playing down the reciprocal U.S. concessions on export controls and visas highlighted elsewhere.

- **Left-leaning U.S. media (e.g., The New York Times, POLITICO)**: Argues the deal is little more than a face-saving pause that returns both sides to where they started, showing that Trump’s tariff brinkmanship gained scant leverage and may have weakened the U.S. position. By foregrounding critical experts and worst-case assessments, the reporting accentuates the administration’s missteps and strategic costs, potentially under-recognising any short-term stability the truce brings to markets and supply chains.
