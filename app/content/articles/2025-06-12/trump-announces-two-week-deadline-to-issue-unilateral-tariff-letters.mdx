# Trump Announces Two-Week Deadline to Issue Unilateral Tariff Letters

On 11 June 2025, Trump scrapped ongoing country-by-country talks and said he will mail fixed tariff schedules to trading partners within 14 days, warning they must accept the terms before the 9 July expiry of his tariff pause.

#### Focusing Facts

- The announced scheme keeps a 10 % universal duty but singles out the EU for 20 % and Vietnam for 46 %, rates first unveiled on 2 April.

- A 10 June ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stayed a lower-court block, so the tariffs remain legally enforceable for at least two more months.

- Only one full deal (UK) and one provisional framework with China have been reached, covering rare-earth supplies and continued Chinese student visas.

#### Context

Presidents have played the tariff card before—McKinley’s 1890 duties and the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act both spiked global rates, while Nixon briefly imposed a 10 % surcharge in 1971 when negotiations stalled. Trump’s letter-bomb strategy nods to that unilateral tradition and reflects two deeper currents: the decades-long erosion of faith in multilateral forums such as the WTO (founded 1995) and a post-2008 political appetite for visible economic nationalism. If he follows through, it could accelerate the fragmentation of the rules-based trading system that underpinned the past 80 years of growth; if he blinks, it may simply reaffirm that tariff threats now function more as negotiating theater than durable policy. Either way, historians in 2125 may view this episode as another marker of the early-21st-century shift from cooperative trade governance toward a patchwork of power-based bilateral deals.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning U.S. media (e.g., Fox News)**: Presents Trump’s unilateral tariff letters as a hard-nosed negotiating tactic that is succeeding and probably won’t require any deadline extension. Highlights Trump’s claimed progress while glossing over legal setbacks or economic downsides, reflecting a pro-administration, conservative framing found in the coverage.

- **U.S. business & financial press (e.g., Business Insider, Bloomberg Business)**: Emphasises the uncertainty around whether Trump will actually follow through, pointing to past missed two-week promises, ongoing court cases, and market worries. Caters to investors’ need for risk assessment, so it foregrounds legal challenges and economic volatility, which can make the administration’s plan appear less credible. ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-unilateral-take-it-or-leave-it-tariffs-coming-soon-2025-6), [Bloomberg Business](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/trump-says-he-will-set-unilateral-tariff-rates-within-two-weeks))

- **Asian regional media (e.g., South China Morning Post, The Straits Times)**: Notes the tariff threat but underscores its questionable enforceability and potential fallout for Asian economies, stressing that Trump often extends or drops such deadlines. Filters the story through regional economic stakes and prior U.S.–China tensions, so it accentuates doubt and possible disruption to highlight Asian vulnerability.
