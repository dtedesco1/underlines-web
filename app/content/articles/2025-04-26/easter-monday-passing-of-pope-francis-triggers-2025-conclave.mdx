# Easter-Monday Passing of Pope Francis Triggers 2025 Conclave

Pope Francis died at 7:35 a.m. on Easter Monday, 21 April 2025, ending a 12-year papacy and immediately opening the process to elect his successor.

#### Focusing Facts

- Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced the death from Casa Santa Marta at 9:45 a.m.; Francis had left Gemelli Hospital only 18 days earlier after a 38-day stay for double pneumonia.

- Francis had named roughly 80 % (currently 98 of 122) of the cardinals under 80 who will vote in the upcoming conclave.

- He is the first pope to die on Easter Monday since the modern liturgical calendar was fixed in 1582.

#### Context

Papal deaths have periodically reset the Catholic Church’s trajectory—think of 1978’s rapid succession from Paul VI to John Paul I to John Paul II, which re-centered the Church on Polish anti-Communism. Francis’s Easter-Monday exit lands the Church at another inflection: the demographic centre of Catholicism has already tilted southward (Africa and Asia supplied two-thirds of baptisms in 2023), and the electors who now gather were largely appointed by a Latin-American Jesuit who tried to loosen Rome’s grip and spotlight the peripheries. Whether his reforms stick will hinge on whether those same cardinals vote continuity or backlash. A century from now, historians may judge this moment less by the death itself than by whether the Church finally broke its Eurocentric pattern—or snapped back toward tradition under the weight of internal polarization and external secularisation. Either way, the 2025 conclave will shape the moral voice of 1.4 billion people deep into the 2100s.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Official Vatican and Church-affiliated outlets (e.g., Vatican News, The Daily Tribune quoting Vatican officials)**: Present the pope’s passing as a sacred home-going of a humble shepherd, stressing his lifelong Gospel service and the simplicity he requested for his funeral rites. Being the institutional voice of the Church, they omit controversies and criticism, offering a reverential narrative that preserves Francis’ legacy and the Vatican’s moral authority.

- **Mainstream Western outlets (e.g., Reuters, The New York Times)**: Cast Francis as a transformative but polarizing reformer whose progressive agenda reordered Vatican power structures and angered conservatives even as it inspired many Catholics. Their political framing highlights conflict and institutional drama—useful for broad audiences—but risks exaggerating Vatican infighting and downplaying the spiritual dimension valued by believers.

- **Local and faith-focused news covering Catholic-majority communities (e.g., The Star in the Philippines, NDTV in India)**: Emphasize global grassroots mourning and interpret the Easter-Monday timing of the death as divinely chosen, focusing on personal testimonies of Catholics who saw Francis as a relatable role model. The devotional tone centers emotion and communal grief, largely sidestepping the pope’s contentious decisions or institutional scandals that complicate a wholly celebratory portrait.
