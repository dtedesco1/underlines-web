# Xi Orders Nationwide Push to Crack AI-Chip Bottleneck at April 2025 Politburo Session

On 25 April 2025, Xi Jinping instructed the Politburo to mobilise China’s “whole-national-system” to overcome shortages of high-end AI chips and create a fully autonomous AI hardware-software stack, promising tax, procurement and regulatory support.

#### Focusing Facts

- The directive was issued at a Politburo study session in Beijing on 25 Apr 2025—the first Politburo meeting explicitly focused on AI since the 2024 U.S. export-control expansion.

- Xi referenced DeepSeek’s January 2025 R1 model, trained on less-advanced domestic chips, as evidence the country can narrow the gap with U.S. firms despite sanctions.

- U.S. tariffs on many Chinese imports now sit at 145 %, while 2024 controls bar H100-class GPUs and other 7 nm or smaller U.S. processors from reaching China.

#### Context

Xi’s call echoes the 1965-70 “Two Bombs, One Satellite” campaign, when Beijing built nuclear weapons and a satellite after the USSR cut off help; once again the state is corralling academia, SOEs and private firms to meet a strategic tech deadline under external pressure.  The announcement highlights two longer arcs: the post-1990s re-nationalisation of critical supply chains and the gradual hardening of Sino-American technological blocs.  Success would validate the idea that advanced AI can run on domestic 7-nm or older nodes—much as Japan leap-frogged U.S. memory leadership in the 1980s—diluting Western leverage and entrenching a dual tech order for half a century.  Failure, conversely, could replay the Soviet computer lag of the 1970s, locking China into a costly chase of an ever-moving frontier.  Either outcome signals that by 2125 the global AI landscape is more likely to be shaped by sovereign industrial strategies than by an open, borderless innovation commons.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business-focused Asian media**: Cast Xi’s push for AI self-reliance as evidence that China is rapidly closing the technology gap—highlighting successes such as DeepSeek and framing Beijing’s strategy as largely on track. Strong commercial interest in China’s growth can lead these outlets to accentuate progress and underplay lingering technological or geopolitical hurdles mentioned only in passing.

- **Western wire services and their syndication partners**: Present Xi’s remarks mainly through the prism of an intensifying U.S.–China tech rivalry, noting some Chinese advances but stressing sanctions, export controls and the strategic contest with Washington. Serving predominantly Western audiences, they risk foregrounding the competitive and security narrative—echoing U.S. policy concerns—and giving less space to Chinese claims of cooperation or shared governance.

- **Global outlets running AFP-style copy emphasising the trade war**: Frame the speech as a defensive response to a punishing tariff battle and chip embargoes, stressing how U.S. measures threaten China’s ambitions and obligate Beijing to “overcome” major obstacles. Reliance on dramatic tariff figures and conflict-heavy framing can sensationalise U.S.–China tensions, potentially exaggerating obstacles to fit a confrontational storyline that keeps readers engaged.
