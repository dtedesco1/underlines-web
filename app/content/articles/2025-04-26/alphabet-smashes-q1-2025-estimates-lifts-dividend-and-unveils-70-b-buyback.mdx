# Alphabet Smashes Q1-2025 Estimates, Lifts Dividend and Unveils $70 B Buyback

Alphabet’s 24 April 2025 report revealed $90.2 bn revenue and $2.81 EPS—both well above consensus—prompting a 5 % dividend hike and a fresh $70 bn share-repurchase plan announced the same day.

#### Focusing Facts

- Google Search advertising generated $50.7 bn in Q1 2025, rising 9.8 % year-on-year despite new China tariffs and ChatGPT-driven ad share erosion fears.

- Google Cloud sales climbed 28 % YoY to $12.3 bn, with operating profit exceeding $2.1 bn after more than tripling from the prior year.

- Shares—down roughly 17 % year-to-date—spiked about 5 % in after-hours trading once the figures and capital-return program were released.

#### Context

Big Tech shrugging off courtroom drama to post record numbers echoes Microsoft’s FY1999 results (revenue +29 %) filed amid the DOJ antitrust trial that same year; immense margins and huge buybacks then, as now, signalled that legal blows rarely cripple entrenched platform businesses overnight. Alphabet’s move fits a 40-year trend of US tech titans converting cash gushers into shareholder returns while doubling down on the next compute wave—AI hardware spending is budgeted at $75 bn in 2025, reminiscent of AT&T’s 1982 post-break-up network build-out. Over a century horizon, the episode matters because it shows the network-effects model remains durable even under tariff whiplash and monopoly rulings: profits fund both investor appeasement and capital-intensive AI infrastructure, reinforcing scale advantages that regulators struggle to unwind. If history rhymes, today’s fines and forced divestiture talk may dent structure but not the underlying data-and-compute flywheel that keeps reasserting itself each decade.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Investor-focused financial media (e.g., Investing.com, Yahoo Finance, Neowin)**: Alphabet’s Q1 numbers were a ‘blowout’, proving the company’s core search, ads, and cloud engines are humming and justifying dividend hikes and a $70 billion buyback that sent the stock higher. Coverage is geared toward traders and shareholders, so stories accentuate upbeat metrics and ignore or downplay antitrust losses and tariff risks that could impair future cash flows.

Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-beats-q1-estimates-raises-dividend-5-and-authorizes-70-billion-in-buybacks-192027280.html))

- **Left-leaning U.S. and U.K. outlets critical of Big Tech power (e.g., The Guardian, Quartz)**: The headline numbers land as Alphabet’s dominance faces unprecedented peril from multiple antitrust suits, Trump-era tariffs, and AI competition that together cloud the company’s long-term outlook. These publications habitually spotlight regulatory and labor angles, so they foreground worst-case legal remedies and trade-war scenarios that resonate with their skeptical-of-monopoly audience even when earnings are strong.

- **European business press (e.g., Euronews)**: Alphabet beat estimates, yet looming U.S. tariff changes and Google’s AI Search ‘Overviews’ hurting independent websites reveal vulnerabilities despite the quarter’s solid growth. European outlets often echo EU policy concerns about American tech giants, so the story pairs good results with cautionary notes on trade policy and platform power over publishers, themes popular with continental regulators.
