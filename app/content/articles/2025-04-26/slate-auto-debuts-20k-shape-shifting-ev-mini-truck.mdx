# Slate Auto Debuts $20K Shape-Shifting EV Mini-Truck

On 25 April 2025, startup Slate Auto publicly revealed a U.S.–assembled electric pickup that can convert into a five-seat SUV and targets a sub-$20,000 price after federal incentives, undercutting every current EV truck in the market.

#### Focusing Facts

- $111 million Series A disclosed in 2023 lists Jeff Bezos, Mark Walter, and Thomas Tull as lead investors.

- Base 57 kWh pack offers 150-mile range; optional 84.3 kWh pack raises it to 240 miles.

- Deliveries are promised for late 2026 with a refundable $50 reservation now open.

#### Context

Henry Ford’s Model T, launched at $825 in 1908 and below $300 by 1925, proved price breakthroughs can reshape mobility; Slate is trying the same for battery trucks. The announcement tests two long trends: America’s 40-year pendulum between ever-larger vehicles and periodic backlashes for compact workhorses (think the 1979-96 wave of imported mini-pickups) and the decade-old quest to democratize EVs beyond the luxury tier. Yet history also warns that bold newcomers—from Tucker’s 1948 sedan to Fisker and Lordstown in the 2010s—often drown in capital costs, regulatory swings, and incumbent push-back; Slate must survive looming tariff wars and a potential rollback of the very tax credit that makes its headline price possible. On a 100-year horizon, success would mark a pivot toward modular, repairable, right-sized electrification; failure would re-affirm how policy volatility and scale economics keep the U.S. fleet supersized and fossil-fuel-leaning.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream tech & business outlets (e.g., NBC News, Mashable)**: Present Slate’s $20K pickup as a long-awaited, game-changing affordable EV that undercuts Tesla and fills a glaring market gap. Coverage leans heavily on the company press release and investors’ marketing language, so it glosses over manufacturing, regulatory, and supply-chain risks that could derail the promised price or 2026 launch.

- **Auto/tech commentators stressing feasibility concerns (e.g., SlashGear, Motor1)**: Argue the mini-truck is intriguing but doubt Slate can actually hit the sub-$20K target or overcome battery costs, political risk, and Bezos-related optics. Pieces emphasize worst-case scenarios and Bezos skepticism, which may amplify reader clicks and position writers as savvy contrarians even though Slate’s production plans are still early-stage.
