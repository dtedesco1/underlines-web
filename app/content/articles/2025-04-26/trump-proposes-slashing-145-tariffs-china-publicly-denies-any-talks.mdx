# Trump Proposes Slashing 145% Tariffs; China Publicly Denies Any Talks

Between 22–24 Apr 2025, President Trump vowed to cut the blanket U.S. tariff on Chinese imports “substantially,” but Beijing immediately said no negotiations exist and demanded all duties be lifted first.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump told an Oval Office press gaggle on 22 Apr 2025 that current 145% tariffs could fall to “roughly 50–65%.”

- China’s Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong stated on 24 Apr 2025 that reports of ongoing talks were “fake news” and insisted the U.S. must remove every unilateral tariff.

- The Weibo hashtag “Trump chickened out” surpassed 150 million views on 24 Apr 2025 after the tariff-cut remarks.

#### Context

Great-power tariff standoffs have a long pedigree: after the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act, retaliatory duties spiralled until 1934’s Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act forced a pull-back; similarly, Reagan’s 1985 pressure on Japan led to the 1987 Semiconductor Accord only when both sides feared broader economic damage. Trump’s 2025 climb-down echoes that pattern: domestic lobbies—this time Walmart and Tesla, not Detroit—signal they have hit their pain threshold, while the target nation stalls, betting that U.S. politics will force concessions. Structurally, the episode illustrates a decade-long trend away from rules-based WTO arbitration toward unilateral tariff swagger and social-media messaging wars. Whether this matters in 2125 depends on whether today’s brinkmanship cements a permanent decoupling of the world’s two largest economies or merely rehearses yet another cyclical bout of protectionism before a negotiated liberalization. Either way, Beijing’s refusal even to acknowledge talks shows that leverage now rests as much in narrative control as in macro-statistics—a shift that could shape trade diplomacy for generations.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Chinese officials and state-aligned voices (statements carried by ProtoThema English, Cryptopolitan)**: Portray Trump’s promise to slash tariffs as a humiliating retreat, insisting Washington must first scrap every unilateral duty while stressing Beijing is under no pressure to negotiate. Designed to bolster domestic nationalism and bargaining leverage, this line downplays China’s own economic headwinds and exaggerates U.S. desperation, as reflected in repeated mockery like the viral “Trump chickened out” hashtag.

- **U.S. right-leaning media (Liberty Nation)**: Presents the tariff climb-down as a tactical softening that may ultimately strengthen Trump’s hand, noting small-business backing for tariffs and framing the episode as part of his ‘Art of the Deal.’ By emphasizing supportive polling and speculative strategic motives, this perspective glosses over the mounting corporate costs and macro-economic risks highlighted by economists and large companies.
