# Iran–US Open Expert-Level Nuclear Talks in Oman After Two Rapid Rounds

On 26 April 2025, Tehran and Washington moved their fledgling negotiations into a first expert-level session in Muscat, marking the third round—and the most technical yet—of efforts to revive constraints on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.

#### Focusing Facts

- Technical delegations headed by Michael Anton for the U.S. and Majid Takht-e Ravanchi for Iran convened in Oman on 26 Apr 2025, following senior-level meetings on 12 Apr (Muscat) and 19 Apr (Rome).

- President Trump has given negotiators an informal 60-day deadline from early April and continues to threaten military strikes if no accord is reached.

- The E3 (France, Germany, U.K.) have warned they may trigger U.N. ‘snapback’ sanctions by August 2025 unless tangible progress materialises.

#### Context

Muscat again serves as the silent stage for U.S.–Iran shuttle diplomacy, echoing the secret 2013-14 Oman back-channel that birthed the 2015 JCPOA. The pattern is familiar: U.S. pressure (sanctions or the 2018 withdrawal) drives Tehran to expand enrichment—from 3.67 % in 2015 to 60 % in 2024—until both sides flirt with the brink and return to talks. What is different in 2025 is a multipolar backdrop: China and Russia explicitly endorse Iran’s ‘peaceful’ nuclear rights while the E3 threaten snapback, and Israel openly strikes Iranian assets. Over a 100-year horizon, the meeting matters because it tests whether the post-1945 non-proliferation norm can still be enforced without war as U.S. primacy wanes. Success would reaffirm diplomacy as in the 1968-1991 SALT/START arc; failure could accelerate a Middle-East cascade reminiscent of 1930s competitive re-armament, with Saudi or Turkish programs next in line.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning US media (e.g., Fox News)**: Portrays the Oman talks as a high-stakes showdown, stressing Trump’s willingness to strike Iran militarily if negotiations falter and framing Tehran’s enrichment as an imminent threat that must be curbed. Language framing Trump as decisive leader and amplifying threats of war caters to a conservative audience supportive of a hard-line Iran policy, downplaying diplomatic concessions mentioned in other reports.

- **Saudi-owned Middle East press (e.g., Asharq Al-Awsat English)**: Emphasises Iran’s public diplomacy—‘throwing the ball in the E3’s court’—while noting U.S. pressure and regional power jockeying, casting Tehran as seeking talks even as American hawks harden demands. Coverage reflects Riyadh’s rivalry with Tehran: highlighting Iranian overtures yet repeatedly questioning their sincerity and foregrounding U.S./Israeli security concerns to justify continued scrutiny of Iran.

- **International mainstream/wire outlets (Reuters, Newsweek, Economic Times)**: Present the negotiations as a cautious but tangible step toward reviving constraints on Iran’s nuclear programme, noting progress at expert level while detailing the substantial gaps that still separate the sides. By relying heavily on official statements from both governments and avoiding overt judgement, these outlets may underplay the geopolitical stakes and power asymmetries, treating claims from all parties as equally credible.
