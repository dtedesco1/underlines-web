# World Bank Forecasts India’s Economic Growth at 6.7% for FY2025/26 and FY2026/27

The World Bank projects India's GDP growth to stabilize at 6.7% annually from April 2025 to March 2027, overcoming a projected slowdown in FY2024/25.

#### Focusing Facts

- In FY2024/25, India's GDP growth is expected to slow to 6.5% before stabilizing at 6.7% the following years.

- South Asia, led by India, is set to grow 6.2% in FY2025/26, with significant contributions from Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

- Bangladesh's economic growth is dampened by political instability and energy shortages, dropping to 4.1% in FY2024/25.

#### Context

Historically, the World Bank's forecasts for emerging economies such as India often reflect broader global economic dynamics, as seen in similar projections during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. This steady growth projection for India comes at a critical juncture, where global uncertainties, such as post-pandemic recoveries and geopolitical tensions, create fluctuating economic environments. The sustained growth trajectory underscores India's effective policy implementation in bolstering domestic industries and investment, contrasting with regional peers who face structural impediments. This moment is essential as India's economic health significantly affects South Asian stability, highlighting the potential for India to anchor regional economic resilience amidst global volatility.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream Economic Analysis**: The World Bank projects that India's economic growth will stabilize at 6.7% for the next two years, driven by robust private consumption, government-led initiatives, and a revival in manufacturing and services sectors. These analyses often rely on macroeconomic indicators and projections without accounting for grassroots economic challenges that may not be captured in high-level data.

- **Economic Optimism**: India is positioned as a stabilizing economic force in South Asia, with consistent growth supported by structural reforms, digitalization, and robust rural demand. The optimistic focus on India's economic stability may overlook potential vulnerabilities, such as political instability or environmental risks, that might threaten long-term growth.
