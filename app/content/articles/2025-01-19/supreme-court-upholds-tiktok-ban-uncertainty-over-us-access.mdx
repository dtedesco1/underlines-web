# Supreme Court Upholds TikTok Ban, Uncertainty Over US Access

On January 17, 2025, the Supreme Court upheld a law mandating TikTok's divestiture from ByteDance by January 19 or face a ban in the US, leaving TikTok's future uncertain under Trump's presidency.

#### Focusing Facts

- Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act on January 17, 2025.

- ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, refused to sell the platform by the January 19 deadline.

- President-elect Donald Trump indicated potential non-enforcement of the ban once in office.

#### Context

Historically, this situation echoes debates over foreign ownership of US assets, akin to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States' (CFIUS) review of Dubai Ports World in 2006, which raised national security concerns. The TikTok ban reflects a trend of increasing scrutiny over foreign tech companies seen as threats to national security. This moment underscores the tension between national security and First Amendment rights, signaling potential shifts in US digital policy under Trump's presidency. The event is critical as it could redefine US-China tech relations and influence global discourse on digital sovereignty and data privacy.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media (e.g., Fox News, The Wall Street Journal)**: These outlets tend to support the TikTok ban due to national security concerns and view the Supreme Court's decision as a necessary measure to protect American data from potential misuse by the Chinese government. The potential bias might stem from a strong national security stance and skepticism towards Chinese companies, reflecting broader ideological commitments to security over business interests.

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The New York Times, Washington Post)**: This group views the TikTok ban with caution, acknowledging national security concerns but also emphasizing the potential infringement on free speech rights and questioning the lack of concrete evidence of misuse by TikTok. Potential bias includes a commitment to free speech and skepticism towards measures that may infringe on civil liberties, as well as possible alignment with tech industry interests.

- **International media (e.g., BBC, Bloomberg)**: These outlets focus on the global implications of the TikTok ban, particularly how it might affect international business relations and highlight TikTok's stance on possibly 'going dark' as a strategic maneuver in the face of uncertain regulatory environments. Bias may include a focus on international business implications and a tendency to emphasize statements from TikTok and international perspectives.
