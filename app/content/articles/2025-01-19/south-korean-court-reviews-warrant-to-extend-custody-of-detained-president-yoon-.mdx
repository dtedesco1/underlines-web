# South Korean Court Reviews Warrant to Extend Custody of Detained President Yoon Suk Yeol

A South Korean court reviews a request to extend detained President Yoon Suk Yeol's custody by 20 days for his failed martial law attempt on December 3.

#### Focusing Facts

- Yoon Suk Yeol attempted to impose martial law on December 3, 2024, which lasted six hours before being rejected by parliament.

- Yoon was impeached and later detained on January 15, 2025, becoming the first sitting South Korean president to face detention.

- The detention is part of an investigation into insurrection, potentially leading to life imprisonment or execution if convicted.

#### Context

This event mirrors South Korea's checkered history with martial law, such as the Gwangju Uprising (1980), when martial law resulted in brutal suppression. The detention reflects a broader trend of accountability for high-ranking officials, reminiscent of former presidents Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak's imprisonments. Yoon's detention, set against a backdrop of significant opposition party power, underscores the political volatility and deep partisan divides in South Korea. This moment represents a pivotal test for South Korea's democratic resilience and legal systems, stressing the precarious balance of power in executive decisions and their legal implications.
