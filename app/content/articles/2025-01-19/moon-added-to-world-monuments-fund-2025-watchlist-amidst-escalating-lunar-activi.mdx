# Moon Added to World Monuments Fund 2025 Watchlist Amidst Escalating Lunar Activities

The World Monuments Fund has added the Moon to its 2025 watchlist of endangered cultural sites due to increasing threats from commercial and governmental lunar missions.

#### Focusing Facts

- SpaceX launched two lunar landers as part of commercial missions on January 15, 2025.

- NASA's Artemis III mission is scheduled for a crewed lunar landing in mid-2027.

- There are over 90 historic sites and artifacts from lunar missions on the Moon, from both the US and former Soviet Union.

#### Context

1. A historical analogy for this inclusion can be drawn from the Antarctic Treaty System established in 1959, which was developed to protect and regulate activities in another remote and internationally significant area. The Moon, much like Antarctica, is seen as a space needing global cooperation for preservation.
2. The addition of the Moon to the endangered heritage list points to a trend of expanding human activities in space, reflecting an era when space exploration is being increasingly privatized and commercialized. This change mirrors historical patterns of exploration followed by exploitation, emphasizing the need for regulatory safeguards akin to those eventually developed for earthly explorations.
3. This moment is significant as it acknowledges space as a cultural and historical site worthy of preservation and reflects a growing awareness of the need for international agreements to manage this new era of space exploration. It underscores the balance needed between aspirational exploration and preservation of historical legacies in space.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The Guardian, The New York Times)**: The Guardian expresses concerns about the potential looting and destruction of lunar heritage due to increased human activity from commercial and government missions, highlighting the importance of international preservation efforts. The Guardian may emphasize environmental and preservation concerns due to its ideological commitment to environmental issues and historical preservation. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jan/16/moon-list-threatened-cultural-sites))

- **Right leaning media (e.g., The Telegraph, Fox News)**: The Telegraph highlights the threat to lunar heritage from private space ventures, raising concerns about exploitation and the risk to historic lunar artefacts. The Telegraph may emphasize the risks associated with private ventures due to a skeptical stance on unregulated commercialization.

- **Chinese state owned media (e.g., CCTV, Xinhua News Agency)**: RT focuses on the risks posed by commercial space travel to lunar sites and emphasizes international collaboration for the protection of extraterrestrial heritage. RT's state-owned nature might influence its emphasis on international collaboration, reflecting China's strategic interests in space exploration.
