# Perplexity AI Proposes Merger with TikTok U.S. Amid Potential Ban

Perplexity AI submitted a merger bid to TikTok's parent ByteDance to form a new entity before TikTok's potential U.S. shutdown on January 19, 2025.

#### Focusing Facts

- The proposed merger would combine TikTok U.S., Perplexity AI, and New Capital Partners.

- President-elect Donald Trump indicated a likely 90-day extension for TikTok to finalize a deal.

- Perplexity AI ended 2024 with a valuation of $9 billion, up from $500 million earlier that year.

#### Context

This development echoes the forced divestment and acquisition efforts during the U.S.-China trade tensions in 2020 and TikTok's attempted sale to companies like Oracle. The rise of AI in business reflects ongoing digital transformation trends that have been reshaping industries since the early 2000s, with AI search engines challenging incumbent tech giants like Google. The attempted merger highlights ongoing national security concerns tied to Chinese tech companies and the increasing role of regulatory and political pressures in shaping global tech landscapes. The event's significance lies in its potential impact on U.S.-China tech relations and the future of AI integration in social media platforms.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: Right leaning media sees the merger between Perplexity AI and TikTok as a strategic move to avoid the TikTok ban in the U.S., which they believe poses a national security risk. There is a potential ideological bias with a focus on national security concerns related to China, which may shape their skepticism of TikTok's operations in the U.S. ([Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/ai-company-perplexity-bids-merge-tiktok-avoid-ban))
