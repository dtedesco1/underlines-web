# Israel and Hamas Agree on Gaza Ceasefire and Hostage Release

On January 18, 2025, Israel's cabinet approved a three-phase ceasefire with Hamas, involving exchanges of hostages and prisoners, scheduled to begin on January 19.

#### Focusing Facts

- In the first phase, 33 Israeli hostages will be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, with the deal lasting six weeks.

- The conflict begun on October 7, 2023, has resulted in over 46,788 Palestinian and 1,139 Israeli deaths.

- The ceasefire was mediated by Qatar, the US, and Egypt, and signed in Doha, Qatar.

#### Context

Historically, this ceasefire echoes previous Israel-Hamas ceasefires, such as the 2014 Gaza war's temporary truce. However, the enduring conflict is rooted in decades of territorial disputes, marked by intermittent violence and failed peace processes. The deal reflects ongoing international mediation efforts, attempting to stabilize the region amidst a complex backdrop of settler colonial tensions and power dynamics. Despite aspirations for peace, the fraught conditions on the ground make any long-term stability uncertain, leaving room for skepticism about the agreement's permanence. This ceasefire represents a pivotal, yet precarious moment in Israeli-Palestinian history.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western mainstream media (e.g., BBC, NBC News)**: The ceasefire agreement is portrayed as a crucial step towards peace, focusing on the practical aspects, such as the hostage exchange and temporary halts in fighting, highlighting both humanitarian concerns and security needs. This group may be biased towards a more balanced or status quo perspective, often reflecting governmental diplomatic narratives and minimizing underlying conflict issues.

- **Middle Eastern media (e.g., Al Jazeera)**: The focus is largely on the destructive impact of Israel's military actions in Gaza, framing the ceasefire as a temporary respite in a broader context of longstanding oppression and hostility towards Palestinians. There may be an inclination to emphasize Palestinian suffering and critique Israeli policies, possibly motivated by regional political dynamics and historical conflicts.

- **Conservative US media (e.g., Fox News)**: The narrative centers around the ceasefire as a strategic victory, emphasizing US leadership roles and Israel’s security prerogatives, noting the role of US Presidents in negotiating the deal. This group may display bias by highlighting narratives that support US political interests and Israel’s security policies, potentially minimizing Palestinian grievances.
