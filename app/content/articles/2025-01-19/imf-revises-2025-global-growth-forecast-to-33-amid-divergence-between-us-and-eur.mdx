# IMF Revises 2025 Global Growth Forecast to 3.3% Amid Divergence Between US and Europe

The IMF revised its 2025 global growth forecast to 3.3%, up from October's 3.2%, citing stronger US demand but highlighting divergence with Europe.

#### Focusing Facts

- IMF projects US economy to grow by 2.7% in 2025, an increase from its October forecast of 2.2%.

- Germany's 2025 growth forecast was downgraded from 0.8% to 0.3% by the IMF.

- IMF flags potential inflation risks from Trump's proposed policies, including tariffs and tax cuts.

#### Context

The historical analogy can be drawn to the 2008 financial crisis, where policy decisions in major economies led to ripple effects worldwide. The IMF’s forecast revision reflects a broader trend of economic divergence, reminiscent of post-2008 recovery phases where different regions rebounded at varied rates. This event matters as it underscores the complexity of global economic recovery post-pandemic, highlighting the U.S.'s accelerated growth against Europe's struggles, and potentially Trump’s policies could spark a 'boom-bust' cycle if inflation risks materialize impacting global financial markets.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The Guardian)**: The IMF's upgrade of UK growth forecasts is seen as an endorsement of the Labour government's fiscal policies and a criticism of potential destabilizing economic policies under Trump. A potential bias stems from supporting policies that align with left-wing economic agendas, such as government investment and regulation.

- **Right leaning media (e.g., Washington Post)**: Although optimistic about the US economy's performance under Trump, there's a warning about potential negative impacts of his policies, such as deregulation and tax cuts leading to a boom-bust cycle. The bias could result from supporting free market policies that are typical of conservative economic strategies.

- **Financial/Business media (e.g., Bloomberg Business)**: The IMF's growth forecast is attributed to strong US demand and decreasing global inflation, while cautioning against policy shifts by Trump that might destabilize economies. Bias may arise from prioritizing market stability and growth, which can influence favorable views towards economic policies promoting business interests.
