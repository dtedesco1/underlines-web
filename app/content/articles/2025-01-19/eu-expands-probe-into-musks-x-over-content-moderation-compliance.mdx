# EU Expands Probe into Musk's X Over Content Moderation Compliance

The EU demanded that Elon Musk's X provide internal documents by February 15, detailing its recommendation algorithms, amid allegations of promoting far-right content.

#### Focusing Facts

- X is required to retain documentation on how its algorithms may change from January 17, 2025, to December 31, 2025.

- The investigation under the Digital Services Act began in December 2023 due to illegal content handling concerns.

- X was previously notified in July 2024 for potential breaches related to misleading users with blue checkmarks and insufficient advertising transparency.

#### Context

This event draws a parallel to historical legal contests over media regulation, reminiscent of the mid-20th-century efforts to curb monopolistic practices in broadcasting. The probe underscores a growing tension between regulatory frameworks like the DSA and the unrestrained influence of tech giants, as they become major players in shaping public discourse. The timing intersects with Elon Musk's alignment with politically divisive figures, suggesting a complex interplay between technological control and democratic processes. This moment highlights the broad impact tech suffices to sway political realities, echoing earlier instances such as the 'fake news' controversies of the 2010s.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **The Guardian, Euronews English, Digital Journal**: These media outlets emphasize concerns over Elon Musk and X potentially manipulating algorithms to promote far-right content and influence European politics, which could jeopardize democratic processes. These publications may be influenced by their broader ideological commitment to liberal democracy and resistance to far-right movements, leading to a critical stance on Musk and his actions.

- **New York Post, www.theepochtimes.com**: These articles focus on criticizing the EU's actions as overreaching or censorship, defending Musk's right to free speech, and highlighting his association with Donald Trump. These publications often hold conservative or right-leaning perspectives that may promote free-market ideals and view regulatory actions as restrictive, particularly against figures aligned with similar political ideologies.
