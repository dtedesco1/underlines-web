# FTC Trial Challenges Meta’s Acquisition-Driven Monopoly

On April 13, 2025, a landmark trial in Washington accused Meta of using its 2012 Instagram and 2014 WhatsApp buys to stifle competition, potentially forcing a breakup of its core social platforms.

#### Focusing Facts

- Meta acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1B and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19B, decisions later scrutinized for monopolistic intent.

- Internal emails, including a 2008 memo stating 'It is better to buy than compete,' are central to the FTC’s allegation of a 'buy-or-bury' strategy.

- Judge James Boasberg is presiding over an eight-week trial, with potential divestiture looming if Meta is found to have illegally neutralized competitors.

#### Context

This trial echoes historical antitrust challenges like the Standard Oil breakup of 1911, as regulators seek to curb monopolistic practices to preserve competition. It reflects a long-term trend where regulators reassess mergers once hailed as strategic wins, now under a new competitive landscape shaped by platforms like TikTok and YouTube. Whether this moment will redefine tech consolidation or merely mark a procedural hurdle remains uncertain on a century-long scale of market evolution.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Regulatory and Antitrust Advocates**: This group emphasizes that Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were designed to neutralize potential competitors and establish a monopoly, undermining a competitive market. They may overstate the anticompetitive impact of these deals to justify stronger regulatory intervention, potentially overlooking broader competitive dynamics in tech.

- **Industry and Meta Defense Voices**: This group argues that Meta’s strategy, including its acquisitions, reflects savvy business decisions in a rapidly evolving and competitive digital landscape. They tend to downplay antitrust concerns to safeguard large tech companies and promote the narrative of innovation and market competition, possibly underemphasizing consumer harm.
