# China Halts Heavy Rare Earth Exports Amid Escalating US Trade Tensions

Effective April 3, 2025, China suspended exports of seven heavy rare earth metals and associated magnets, a move seen as retaliatory amid Trump's heightened tariffs.

#### Focusing Facts

- On April 3, China stopped exporting seven heavy rare earth metals, including dysprosium and yttrium, critical for tech and defense.

- New export controls require special licensing, potentially delaying shipments by 60 days or more, while Trump’s administration plans stockpiling measures.

- China's restrictions affect about 90% of global rare earth magnet supply and echo its 2010 export halt to Japan.

#### Context

This move mirrors historical strategic resource controls, notably China's 2010 suspension to Japan during territorial disputes and Deng Xiaoping’s 1987 assertion of rare earths as a geopolitical tool. Over the past decades, global industries have increasingly depended on Chinese processing—accounting for up to 90% of rare earth magnet manufacture—revealing deep vulnerabilities in global supply chains. On a long-term scale, such actions underscore the shift toward resource weaponization in trade conflicts, signaling systemic challenges that, much like the 20th-century energy crises, could spur lasting shifts in international production and security alliances over the coming century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: They portray China’s suspension of rare earth exports as a strategic and provocative move to exert monopoly power and undermine critical U.S. industries amid a tough trade war with President Trump’s policies. This perspective may exaggerate the threat from China and strongly support nationalist policies, often overlooking broader economic complexities and mutual dependencies.

- **Business centrist media**: They analyze the event as a significant economic risk that exposes U.S. vulnerabilities in supply chains for defense, automotive, and technology sectors, underscoring the urgent need for domestic alternatives and stockpiling measures. This view can lean toward immediate pragmatic fixes and market-driven solutions while underplaying long-term strategic and systemic issues, reflecting industry and policy advocacy biases.

- **Left leaning media**: They frame China’s export restrictions as a retaliatory response to aggressive U.S. trade policies, interpreting the move within a broader critique of capitalist and imperialist conflicts. This perspective might overemphasize state retribution and class struggle narratives, potentially dismissing legitimate economic concerns in favor of anti-imperialist rhetoric.
