# EU Unites to Counter US Tariffs amid Trade Tensions

On March 30, 2025, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared a unified EU response at the Hanover trade fair if US tariffs on steel, aluminium, and auto imports—announced amid provocative annexation comments regarding Canada—are enforced.

#### Focusing Facts

- US imposed a 25% tariff on steel, aluminium, and auto imports effective mid-March 2025.

- Scholz, speaking at the Hannover Messe, reiterated Canada's sovereignty against US annexation rhetoric and confirmed EU readiness to act collectively.

- EU countermeasures are slated to begin in April 2025 if the tariffs go into effect.

#### Context

This event marks a significant moment in modern trade disputes reminiscent of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which once escalated global economic conflict. Today's tensions reflect long-standing trends of economic nationalism and the struggle for technological sovereignty in a globalized market, with EU’s collective strategy signaling a shift towards coordinated responses over unilateral protectionism. Over the next century, such maneuvers could reshape global trade norms, highlighting how modern geopolitical rivalries echo historical tariff wars while reconfiguring alliances and economic policies for future stability.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream European establishment**: They emphasize a firm, united EU response against U.S. tariffs while strongly defending Canada’s sovereignty in the face of provocative U.S. rhetoric. Their assertive stance may overlook internal EU disagreements and can escalate tensions by downplaying the complexities of international trade negotiations.

- **Moderate EU negotiators**: They stress that while the EU stands ready to retaliate against U.S. tariffs, compromise and ongoing cooperation remain the preferred path. This perspective might underplay the potential risks of trade conflicts by favoring diplomatic concessions, potentially glossing over the pressures of domestic economic interests.
