# Wang Yi’s Moscow Visit Amplifies ‘Friends Forever’ Pledge Amid Shifting Global Alliances

On March 31–April 2, 2025, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Moscow, reinforcing the longstanding 'friends forever' alliance with Russia and signaling readiness for a binding peace agreement in Ukraine amid emerging US-Russia rapprochement.

#### Focusing Facts

- Wang Yi commenced his three-day Moscow visit on March 31, 2025, with talks scheduled with Russian FM Sergey Lavrov and an upcoming meeting with Putin.

- China and Russia had declared a 'no limits' strategic partnership in February 2022, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has met Putin over 40 times in the past decade.

- US President Donald Trump’s recent conciliatory stance supports efforts toward a peace settlement in Ukraine, as noted by Wang during the visit.

#### Context

This event echoes historical instances of strategic realignment, such as Nixon’s 1972 visit to China and the Cold War détente that reshaped global alliances. The enduring rhetoric of 'friends forever' reflects an evolved partnership between China and Russia, now responding to resurgent US-Russia dialogue and complicated regional conflicts like the protracted Ukraine war. On a centennial scale, these dynamics reveal a broader trend where multipolar cooperation challenges the rigid bipolarity of earlier eras, potentially heralding a more integrated yet unpredictable international order.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **State-Aligned Media**: This group emphasizes the deep, strategic friendship between Russia and China—using phrases like 'friends forever, never enemies' to signal an unyielding and mutually beneficial alliance. Their narrative is likely influenced by state interests and official geopolitics, leading them to accentuate positive cooperation while downplaying any complications or divergent interests.

- **Western and Critical Analysis Outlets**: This group presents a more nuanced picture by noting that while Beijing praises the Russia–China partnership, it also stresses the importance of neutrality in the Ukraine conflict and hints at diplomatic maneuvering to balance global relations. Such outlets may be predisposed to question the solidity and ideological depth of the declared partnership, emphasizing pragmatic statecraft over ideological camaraderie.
