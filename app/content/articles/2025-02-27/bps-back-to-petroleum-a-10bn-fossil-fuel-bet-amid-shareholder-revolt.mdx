# BP’s ‘Back to Petroleum’: A $10bn Fossil Fuel Bet Amid Shareholder Revolt

BP has fundamentally reset its strategy, scrapping its renewable energy targets to boost oil and gas production and increase annual fossil fuel investment to $10bn.

#### Focusing Facts

- BP will invest $10bn annually in oil and gas through 2027.

- The company abandoned its 50GW renewable generation target by 2030 and plans to boost oil output to 2.3–2.5 million barrels per day.

- Activist investor Elliott Management now holds nearly 5% and a group of 48 shareholders is demanding a vote on the strategic shift.

#### Context

BP's shift mirrors historical industry recalibrations—comparable to its 1997 rebranding as 'Beyond Petroleum' under Lord Browne, only here the firm reverts to prioritizing fossil fuels amid pressure from underperforming returns relative to peers. This realignment reflects long-term systemic tensions between sustainable investments and immediate profitability. The renewed focus on oil and gas, bolstered by market and political shifts like pro-fossil fuel policies under re-elected leaders, signals a cyclical trend where companies pivot in response to activist pressures and changing investor sentiments. Over a century-long view, BP's move may catalyze further debates on energy transition vs. traditional fossil fuel investments, impacting industry trajectories well into the future.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Profit-focused investors and conservative business media**: They argue that BP’s pivot back to oil and gas is a necessary move to boost shareholder returns and revitalize profitability after underperformance in renewables. This view tends to prioritize short-term financial gains over long-term environmental considerations and may underplay the risks associated with fossil fuel dependency.

- **Environmental advocates and cautious long-term investors**: They condemn BP’s abandonment of aggressive renewable investments, warning that the strategy shift jeopardizes meaningful climate action and may lead to stranded assets. This perspective might overemphasize environmental risks and the negative externalities of fossil fuels, while potentially undervaluing the financial pressures the company faces.
