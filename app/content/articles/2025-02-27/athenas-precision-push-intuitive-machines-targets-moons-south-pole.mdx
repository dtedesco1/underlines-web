# Athena’s Precision Push: Intuitive Machines Targets Moon’s South Pole

On February 26, 2025, Intuitive Machines will launch its upgraded Athena lunar lander aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9, aiming for a precise touchdown near the Moon’s south pole on March 6.

#### Focusing Facts

- Launch set for Feb 26, 2025 at 7:17 p.m. EST from Kennedy Space Center.

- Athena is engineered to land near Mons Mouton with a PRIME-1 drill and supporting payloads, improving lessons from its predecessor, Odysseus.

- The mission also carries additional assets including the MAPP rover, Grace hopper, and NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer satellite for comprehensive lunar exploration.

#### Context

Athena’s mission builds on the legacy of early lunar landings, echoing the challenges and triumphs of Apollo 17 in 1972, yet set within a modern framework of commercial partnerships and ambitious payload integrations. The effort reflects a broader transition from government-led to commercially-driven lunar exploration, fueled by NASA’s CLPS initiative and private sector innovation. In a century marked by milestone space endeavors—from the Cold War space race to today's private rocket launches—this mission signifies a turning point in sustainable lunar resource utilization and the long-term vision of establishing a lunar economy that could underpin humanity's interplanetary future.
