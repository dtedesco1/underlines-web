# NASA Slashes 2024 YR4 Impact Risk to Near-Zero in 2032 Update

Following weeks of concern over a 3% impact probability, refined observations have reduced asteroid 2024 YR4’s collision risk with Earth for December 2032 to virtually nil.

#### Focusing Facts

- Initial collision risk for Earth was pegged at up to 3.1% before new data reduced it to as low as 0.001-0.004%.

- Despite the Earth threat drop, there remains a 1.7% chance that 2024 YR4 could impact the Moon on Dec. 22, 2032.

- The asteroid, estimated at 40-90 meters wide, was first discovered in December 2024 using Chilean telescopic observations.

#### Context

This update mirrors historical risk reassessments such as the 2004 Apophis event, where initial threat levels were significantly revised with improved data. The evolving analysis, now corroborated by agencies like ESA and NASA and enhanced by the James Webb Space Telescope, reflects a broader trend toward increasingly precise threat monitoring using advanced astronomical instruments. In the long view of planetary defense—a progression from rudimentary early-warning systems during the Cold War to today’s global collaborations—this event underscores how iterative observations refine risk projections, offering reassurance without complacency in the broader quest for space safety over the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Science-focused mainstream media**: These outlets report that updated NASA and ESA observations have drastically lowered the chance of asteroid 2024 YR4 impacting Earth, effectively reassuring the public of its negligible threat. They tend to emphasize precise scientific updates and official reassurances, which could downplay earlier concerns and avoid exploring lingering uncertainties.

- **Sensationalist media**: This group sensationalizes the threat, with narratives suggesting catastrophic impacts for cities like Mumbai and Kolkata, even after the reassurances issued by space agencies. The focus on dramatic, clickbait headlines may exaggerate risks to attract attention, overshadowing the scientifically verified updates that minimize the actual threat.
