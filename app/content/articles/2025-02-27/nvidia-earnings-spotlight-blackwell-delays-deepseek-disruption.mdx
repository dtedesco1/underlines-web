# Nvidia Earnings Spotlight: Blackwell Delays & DeepSeek Disruption

In late February 2025, Nvidia’s upcoming Q4 earnings are under intense scrutiny as delays in its Blackwell AI chip rollout and potential U.S. export restrictions collide with disruptive, low-cost AI models from China's DeepSeek.

#### Focusing Facts

- Nvidia is forecast to register a 72% revenue surge to about $38 billion for Q4.

- Blackwell chip ramp-up has been pushed from early 2025 to mid-2025 due to technical and production challenges.

- DeepSeek's breakthrough led to a one-day market cap loss of nearly $593 billion for Nvidia.

#### Context

Technological breakthroughs have long disrupted market leaders—as seen during the 1980s memory chip crisis when cheaper Japanese models undermined U.S. firms. Now, Nvidia faces a similar test, navigating production glitches, looming export controls reminiscent of Cold War-era trade concerns, and fierce competition from cost-efficient models like DeepSeek. This convergence of internal delays and external competitive pressures reflects a broader trend where even industry titans must continuously innovate in a globalized, regulated market. While short-term volatility might unsettle investors, the enduring evolution of AI infrastructure and long-term technological adoption could ultimately reaffirm Nvidia's strategic dominance over a century-long horizon.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Bullish Wall Street Analysts**: They emphasize Nvidia’s continued dominance in the AI chip market through robust demand from major tech companies and strong long-term earnings potential. Their focus on impressive revenue projections and future growth may overlook short-term operational challenges and external risks, reflecting a bias from traditional high-growth tech optimism.

- **Cautious Investment Observers**: They highlight near-term risks including potential production delays, regulatory risks, and disruptive competition from lower-cost Chinese models like DeepSeek. By concentrating on short-term market fluctuations and headline risks, they might overstate the immediate challenges at the expense of Nvidia’s long-term industry leadership. ([Yahoo!
