# Hong Kong’s Belt-Tightening Budget: 7% Spending Cuts, 10,000 Job Reductions & HK$1bn AI Push

On February 26, 2025, Financial Secretary Paul Chan unveiled a robust fiscal consolidation plan featuring a cumulative 7% cut in public expenditure, targeted civil service job cuts, and a HK$1 billion investment in an AI research institute, as part of measures to address a deepening deficit amid global and domestic headwinds.

#### Focusing Facts

- Mandates a 7% reduction in public recurrent expenditure through 2027/28, including 2% annual cuts translating to 10,000 civil service jobs by April 2027.

- The fiscal deficit is expected to approach HK$100 billion for the current financial year, nearly doubling initial forecasts.

- HK$1 billion allocated to establish an AI R&D institute to spur future economic innovation.

#### Context

This budget move echoes historical episodes where governments were forced to adopt austerity measures in response to fiscal crises, such as Europe’s post-2008 austerity drives. Unlike the prolonged downturn during Japan’s 1990s ‘lost decade’, Hong Kong now faces an acute convergence of external pressures—from US trade policy shifts impacting tariffs on Hong Kong goods to a severe downturn in revenue from land sales—that necessitate a rapid policy pivot. Over a 100-year horizon, this aggressive recalibration highlights the vulnerabilities inherent in revenue models heavily reliant on property and land sales, while also marking an early pivot toward a tech-driven growth strategy that may redefine fiscal resilience in an increasingly interconnected global economy.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International business-focused media**: These outlets present the budget measures—including spending cuts, job freezes, and a major push into AI—as pragmatic steps to restore fiscal balance and adapt Hong Kong’s economy to global headwinds. They focus on market-friendly narratives and may downplay potential social costs, emphasizing innovation and investor confidence.

- **Critical economic commentators**: This group argues that while fiscal consolidation is necessary, the measures risk being insufficient and could benefit from deeper structural reforms to address long-term economic challenges. Their analysis often centers on shortcomings and potential risks of austerity, possibly overemphasizing economic vulnerabilities over the need for immediate fiscal discipline.
