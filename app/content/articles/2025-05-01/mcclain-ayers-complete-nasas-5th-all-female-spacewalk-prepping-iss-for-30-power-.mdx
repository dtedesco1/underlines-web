# McClain & Ayers Complete NASA’s 5th All-Female Spacewalk, Prepping ISS for 30% Power Boost

On 1 May 2025, Anne McClain—returning after a 2019 suit-size setback—and first-timer Nichole Ayers spent roughly 6½ hours outside the International Space Station relocating a communications antenna and installing hardware for new rollout solar arrays, marking NASA’s fifth women-only EVA.

#### Focusing Facts

- To safeguard the mission, ISS controllers raised the station’s orbit on 30 Apr 2025 to avoid debris from a 2005 Chinese Long March rocket body.

- NASA lists 20 women among its 47 active astronauts (42.5%) as of May 2025.

- The forthcoming IROSA panels are slated to raise ISS power capacity from 160 kW to about 215 kW—a 34% jump.

#### Context

McClain’s belated walk echoes Sally Ride’s 1983 shuttle flight: both milestones came years after the hardware (spacesuits then shuttle seats) was nominally ‘ready’ yet still sized for men. Just as Ride’s flight followed two decades after Valentina Tereshkova’s 1963 solo, today’s EVA reminds us that symbolic “firsts” don’t automatically translate into structural parity. The episode sits at the confluence of two long arcs: (1) the gradual feminization of high-status technical fields and (2) the ISS’s slow evolution from Cold-War prestige project (first module, 1998) into a power-hungry research platform requiring constant upgrades. On a century horizon, the bigger story may be the routine maintenance of orbital infrastructure under mounting debris threats; that NASA can schedule an all-female crew for the 93rd U.S. ISS spacewalk suggests gender is becoming operationally unremarkable, while the maneuver to dodge a 20-year-old rocket fragment underscores how congested Earth orbit could be the limiting factor for human activity aloft long after gender balance is achieved.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian general-interest news outlets (The Times of India, India Today, Devdiscourse, LatestLY)**: Frame the spacewalk as a landmark moment for women, stressing its symbolic value for gender equality and the "growing presence and leadership of women in space exploration." Their celebratory tone may gloss over NASA’s ongoing gender imbalance that the same pieces briefly acknowledge (20 of 47 astronauts are women), turning a routine maintenance walk into a national-pride, feel-good empowerment story.

- **U.S. and UK mainstream outlets running the Associated Press wire (Boston Globe, Yahoo, Daily Mail, Pulse24)**: Present the walk primarily as a newsworthy but routine ISS maintenance event, noting both the glove snag delay and the fact it is only the fifth all-female walk in 60 years. Reliance on the same AP copy gives an air of neutrality yet can underplay the historical or social context, treating the gender angle as a sidebar while repeating identical language across outlets.

- **Local/technical outlets focused on operational details (WGAL-8 Lancaster/Harrisburg, RTTNews)**: Highlight the technical objectives—antenna relocation and IROSA bracket installation—and power-boost statistics, emphasising mission logistics over its all-female crew. By foregrounding engineering specifics and omitting broader gender discussion, they risk minimizing the social significance in favor of portraying NASA as an efficient, business-like operation.
