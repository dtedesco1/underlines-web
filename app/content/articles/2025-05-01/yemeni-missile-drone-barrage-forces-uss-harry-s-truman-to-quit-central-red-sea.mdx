# Yemeni Missile-Drone Barrage Forces USS Harry S. Truman to Quit Central Red Sea

On 28-29 Apr 2025, Yemen’s Ansarallah-led armed forces said they hit the US carrier USS Harry S. Truman with hours-long cruise-, ballistic- and drone strikes, causing the ship to pull back toward the Suez Canal and prompting the Pentagon to prepare its withdrawal.

#### Focusing Facts

- Yemeni spokesman Gen. Yahya Saree claimed the salvo began 28 Apr 2025, lasted “several hours,” and pushed the Truman “to the far north of the Red Sea.”

- A US F/A-18E Super Hornet, worth ≈$60 mn, slid off the carrier’s deck into the Red Sea during an abrupt evasive turn, CNN confirmed on 29 Apr 2025.

- The same operation included a Yaffa-drone strike on an Israeli facility in Ashkelon, according to Yemeni and Lebanese outlets.

#### Context

If verified, this would be the first time since Iran’s 1988 missile strike on the USS Samuel B. Roberts that a US capital ship has been forced from a theater by regional non-state actors.  It underscores a 20-year trend: inexpensive precision drones and cruise missiles (seen in Hezbollah’s 2006 anti-ship hit on INS Hanit and the 2019 Abqaiq attacks) are eroding the sanctuary once enjoyed by blue-water navies.  Historically, fleets lose deterrence the moment coastal defenders gain stand-off reach—think Japanese torpedo boats driving Russia’s Baltic fleet from Port Arthur in 1904.  Whether Truman was actually damaged is unproven—claims come from pro-Ansarallah media, while Washington is silent—but the mere retreat signals that $13 bn carrier groups can be strategically pinned down by actors whose entire annual budget is smaller than one Super Hornet squadron.  On a 100-year arc this episode hints at a shift: sea control is becoming multipolar and littoral states (and even insurgent movements) can deny access along chokepoints like Bab al-Mandeb, potentially reshaping global trade routes much as the 1956 Suez Crisis did.  If such asymmetric pressure persists, future great-power navies may rethink carrier deployments near heavily armed coastlines, marking a gradual sunset of the carrier-centric order that dominated since 1945.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Houthi-aligned Yemeni state media (Saba News Agency)**: Depicts the missile and drone barrage as a decisive Yemeni counter-strike that damaged or at least chased away the USS Truman and will continue until U.S. attacks stop. Relies exclusively on military communiqués from Ansarallah, offering no corroboration from neutral sources and likely inflating battlefield success for domestic morale and diplomatic leverage.

- **Iranian state-affiliated media (Tehran Times, Mehr News, AhlulBayt)**: Presents the incident as evidence that U.S. forces were humiliated—citing a lost F/A-18 and a hurried retreat—while hailing Yemeni strikes as legitimate resistance allied with Iran’s regional axis. Echoes and embellishes Ansarallah claims without independent verification, using sensational details to reinforce Tehran’s anti-U.S. narrative and bolster the image of the ‘Axis of Resistance.’ ([Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/512435/Truman-aircraft-carrier-flees-Yemeni-missiles-in-Red-Sea), [Mehr News Agency](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/231188/Yemen-attacks-US-aircraft-carrier-Harry-Truman-spokesman))

- **Pro-resistance Lebanese and Palestinian outlets (Al-Manar TV, Palestine Info Center)**: Frames Yemen’s attacks on the carrier and an Israeli site as a ‘blessed’ act of solidarity with Gaza and part of a broader anti-Israel, anti-U.S. resistance front. Coverage is explicitly ideological, celebrating the strikes, minimising any risks to civilians, and serving Hezbollah/Hamas propaganda aims rather than providing balanced reporting.
