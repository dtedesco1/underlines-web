# Judge Refers Apple for Criminal Contempt Over 27% ‘Work-Around’ Fee

On 30 Apr 2025, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers held Apple in contempt for flouting her 2021 Epic Games injunction, ordered the company to scrap its new 27 % off-app commission immediately, and sent the matter to federal prosecutors for possible criminal charges against Apple and finance VP Alex Roman.

#### Focusing Facts

- Rogers’ 80-page order (filed 30 Apr 2025) refers Apple and Alex Roman to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California to probe criminal contempt.

- The ruling bars Apple, effective immediately, from imposing the 27 % fee or any other levy on web-based purchases linked from iOS apps.

- Court documents reveal CEO Tim Cook overrode internal compliance advice, and Rogers said Roman ‘outright lied under oath’ about when the fee was set.

#### Context

Tech titans ignoring court decrees is not new: Microsoft drew Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson’s ire in 1998 for breaching a 1995 consent decree on bundling—an episode that foreshadowed the browser-wars settlement. Apple’s gambit shows the same calculus: keep the tollbooth up until sanctions truly bite. The decision crystallises two broader forces: a re-energised antitrust posture toward digital gatekeepers (U.S. cases, EU Digital Markets Act 2024) and a century-long oscillation between closed and open distribution systems, from AT&T’s 1913 Kingsbury Commitment to IBM’s 1956 consent decree. If prosecutors move ahead, it would be among the first criminal contempt actions against a $3 trillion firm, signalling that platform dominance does not inoculate against personal or corporate liability. Over a 100-year horizon, the precedent may matter less for this specific “Apple tax” than for whether software ecosystems evolve toward open, interchangeable payment rails or remain vertically integrated fiefdoms—setting norms for whatever replaces the smartphone itself.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left-leaning media (e.g., The Guardian, The Washington Post)**: Apple deliberately defied the antitrust injunction, and the ruling is a victory for developers and consumers that could finally rein in its monopolistic power over the App Store. These outlets are generally skeptical of Big Tech and emphasize antitrust enforcement, so their framing spotlights Apple’s misconduct and the broader competition stakes while giving Epic and regulators sympathetic treatment. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/30/apple-fortnite-court-order-violation), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/30/apple-violated-court-order-app-store/))

- **Financial/business news outlets (e.g., CNBC, Reuters)**: The contempt finding exposes Apple to serious legal and financial risk, illustrating that its 27 % off-app fee violated the 2021 order and could invite criminal contempt charges. Because they cater to investors and market watchers, their coverage foregrounds procedural details and potential liabilities, often treating consumers and developers as secondary considerations.

- **Mainstream outlets emphasizing Apple’s response (e.g., BBC, Business Insider)**: Although noting the judge’s harsh condemnation, the stories highlight Apple’s position that it "strongly disagrees" with the decision, will comply, and intends to appeal. Heavy reliance on Apple’s corporate statements in the name of balance can soften the perceived severity of the court’s findings and allow Apple to influence the narrative.
