# Vatican Fixes 7 May 2025 Start Date for Conclave to Elect Pope Francis’s Successor

In a 28 April general congregation, cardinals set 7 May 2025 for the sealed Sistine Chapel conclave, moving from mourning to the election phase.

#### Focusing Facts

- Decision was taken at the 5th general congregation on 28 Apr 2025 after Francis’s 26 Apr funeral.

- 135 voting cardinals—108 appointed by Francis—will enter the conclave; only those under 80 may vote.

- Election requires a two-thirds super-majority, i.e., at least 90 votes, and if no result by the 34th ballot the choice narrows to the top two candidates.

#### Context

The college has not set so late a start since 1922, when Pius XI’s conclave opened 16 days after Benedict XV’s death; like then, logist­ics and factional talks dictated timing.  The announcement caps Francis’s twelve-year project of diversifying the College—Asians, Africans and Latin Americans now form a majority—echoing Leo XIII’s 19th-century push to globalise episcopal appointments.  This conclave therefore tests a long-term pivot of Catholic gravity away from Europe that began with John Paul II in 1978 and accelerated under Francis.  On a century scale the event matters because the pope remains the only non-state leader with moral influence over 1.3 billion people; which way the electors jump—toward continuity of Francis’s inclusive stance or a restorationist course—will shape debates on war, migration, climate and human sexuality well beyond ecclesial walls.  The homogenous framing of most outlets, all drawing on the same Vatican press briefings, masks real ideological rifts (e.g., African opposition to same-sex blessings, U.S. traditionalist backlash) that could prolong voting beyond the brisk two-day elections of 2005 and 2013; a repeat of the 1274 Viterbo deadlock is unlikely, but a multi-day stalemate would broadcast to the world that the Church’s internal realignment is still unfinished.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream Western media (e.g., BBC, The New York Times, CBS News)**: Present the conclave primarily as a historic procedural event, detailing dates, vote counts, and global interest in the election process. Coverage leans secular and event-driven, glossing over theological debates or internal Church tensions, which can understate conflicts highlighted elsewhere. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05vg7dw72o), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/europe/papal-conclave-date.html))

- **Catholic institutional outlets (e.g., Catholic News Agency, National Catholic Reporter)**: Frame the conclave as a deeply spiritual moment of discernment guided by the Holy Spirit, stressing liturgy, oaths, and continuity with Church tradition. By echoing Vatican briefings and emphasizing unity, they may minimize mention of factions or controversies that could complicate the narrative. ([Catholic News Agency](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/263709/conclave-date-set-for-may-7), [National Catholic Reporter](https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/conclave-elect-next-pope-begin-may-7))

- **Right-leaning media (e.g., Breitbart)**: Highlight the conclave’s centuries-old secrecy and rigid rules, portraying it as a bastion of tradition shielding the Church from modern political influence. Focus on ritual and avoidance of "overt politicking" implicitly supports conservative resistance to recent progressive reforms without acknowledging internal calls for change.
