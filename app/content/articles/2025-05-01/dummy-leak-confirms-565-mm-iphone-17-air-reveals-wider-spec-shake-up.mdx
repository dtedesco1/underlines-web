# Dummy Leak Confirms 5.65 mm iPhone 17 Air, Reveals Wider Spec Shake-Up

Late-April 2025 leaks exposed physical mock-ups and spec sheets showing Apple will swap its slow-selling Plus model for a 5.65 mm-thin “iPhone 17 Air,” bump every iPhone 17 to 12 GB RAM, and drop a planned anti-glare coating for the Pro screens.

#### Focusing Facts

- 30 Apr 2025 GSM Arena video shows iPhone 17 Air dummy units measuring just 5.65 mm thick, the thinnest iPhone to date.

- 29 Apr 2025 Weibo post by “Digital Chat Station,” echoed by AppleInsider, claims all iPhone 17 models will ship with 12 GB LPDDR5 RAM.

- 28 Apr 2025 MacRumors reports Apple canceled the super scratch-resistant anti-reflective display coating for iPhone 17 Pro due to slow production scaling.

#### Context

Apple’s obsession with thinness echoes the 2005 Motorola RAZR V3 (13.9 mm) and Apple’s own 2014 iPhone 6 Plus “Bendgate” fiasco; both devices proved how pushing form factor limits can backfire.  Today’s leak shows Cupertino again trading battery capacity, port symmetry, and durability for millimetres, even as global users prize battery longevity and camera power.  The simultaneous RAM bump hints that on-device AI (‘Apple Intelligence’) is becoming the new spec battleground, just as 64-bit chips re-framed smartphones in 2013.  Over a 100-year horizon this moment is a microcosm of two long arcs: relentless consumer-electronics miniaturisation since the 1950 Bell Labs transistor, and the fragile, globally dispersed supply chains that make such feats possible—now strained by tariff threats and rare-earth controls.  Whether the ultra-slim Air delights or disappoints, the leak matters because it spotlights the limits of aesthetic innovation and the rising primacy of silicon and software capabilities in a maturing smartphone era.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Apple-enthusiast consumer tech blogs (e.g., 9to5Mac, GSM Arena)**: They frame the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air as an exciting aesthetic breakthrough and a strategic stepping-stone toward Apple’s first foldable iPhone. Coverage leans into hype that drives clicks from Apple fans, so shortcomings such as battery trade-offs or port oddities are downplayed or treated as negligible.

- **Critical Apple-focused opinion sites (e.g., Macworld, MacRumors)**: They warn that chasing record thinness will force painful compromises like weaker batteries, awkward USB-C placement, and other usability sacrifices that outweigh any wow factor. Their contrarian tone attracts readership by puncturing Apple marketing narratives, so drawbacks may be emphasized before full specs or real-world tests are known.

- **U.S. political figures and aligned outlets discussing reshoring (e.g., Tech Times quoting Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick)**: They claim Apple intends to shift iPhone production to the United States using advanced robotics, portraying it as proof that tariff pressure and industrial policy can bring manufacturing home. The narrative serves a protectionist political agenda and relies on second-hand statements rather than Apple confirmation, so technical and economic hurdles are largely glossed over.
