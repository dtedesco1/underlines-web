# Colossal Biosciences Unveils Genetically Engineered 'Dire Wolves' via 20 Gene Edits

On October 1, 2024, Colossal Biosciences announced three wolf pups engineered to exhibit dire wolf traits through targeted gene editing and cloning, reviving an icon of Pleistocene fauna.

#### Focusing Facts

- Three pups—Romulus, Remus (born October 1, 2024) and Khaleesi (born January 30, 2025)—were produced by modifying gray wolf DNA with 20 key gene edits.

- The process used ancient DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull to identify and insert 15 dire wolf-specific genetic variants, plus 5 for coat modification.

- The animals are housed in secure preserves (800 to 2,000 acres) with ongoing monitoring, and are not intended to breed.

#### Context

This event mirrors past endeavors in de-extinction, such as the brief resurrection of the Pyrenean ibex in 2003 and Dolly the sheep’s cloning in 1996. However, unlike earlier efforts which often faced immediate biological or ecological hurdles, Colossal’s approach leverages modern CRISPR techniques to transfer select traits from ancient dire wolves into living gray wolves. This raises enduring questions about species identity and the role of de-extinct organisms in current ecosystems—a debate that dates back to early 20th century genetic studies. While this breakthrough is celebrated as a technological milestone, its long-term ecological impact remains uncertain, reflecting broader historical tensions between technological optimism and nature’s enduring complexity.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Science and Technical Media**: This group scrutinizes the genetic editing process, emphasizing that the so-called 'dire wolf' is essentially a grey wolf with a few modifications rather than a full resurrection of an extinct species. They prioritize technical accuracy and may downplay the broader conservation or emotional implications in favor of detailed evolutionary and genomic analysis.

- **Entertainment and Pop Culture Media**: This group focuses on the spectacle and cultural impact of the de-extinction event, highlighting its ties to pop culture icons like 'Game of Thrones' and celebrating the breakthrough as a sensational milestone. They often emphasize dramatic visuals and celebrity involvement, potentially glossing over the scientific nuances and ethical complexities for broader appeal.
