# Trump Tariffs Trigger Global Market Meltdown and Diplomatic Maneuvers

On April 7, global stock markets tumbled sharply as President Trump’s aggressive new tariffs and reciprocal measures reignited fears of a tariff-driven recession.

#### Focusing Facts

- On April 2, Trump imposed a baseline 10% tariff on all imports, later extending reciprocal duties to nearly 90 countries.

- Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell almost 9% in early trading, triggering circuit breakers and a severe sell-off in banking stocks.

- South Korea announced up to 100 trillion won ($68 billion) in emergency liquidity measures amid market panic.

- U.S. stock indices dropped 12%–21%, resulting in a market loss nearing $6.6 trillion and triggering a bear market declaration.

#### Context

This sudden market collapse echoes historical protectionist episodes such as the 1930 Smoot–Hawley Tariff, which deepened global trade tensions and contributed to the Great Depression. Unlike the less interconnected past, today’s markets are globally entwined, meaning a policy decision in the US can trigger immediate and widespread economic repercussions. This event reflects long-standing cycles where protectionist measures spur short-term shocks but also force policy recalibrations. While the current panic might eventually subside, the underlying trend of rising trade tensions—if unchecked—could reconfigure the global economic order over the next century, challenging the evolution of international cooperation initiated post-World War II.

- **RT Business News**: This group portrays Trump's tariffs as sparking an intense, near-chaotic global market reaction, underlining dramatic declines and the possibility of an 'economic nuclear war'. Their framing can reflect an agenda to undermine US policy credibility by emphasizing the catastrophic impacts, potentially exaggerating the chaos for ideological effect.

- **The Guardian**: This outlet presents a nuanced view, noting initial market tumble but also signs of recovery and potential diplomatic engagement to mitigate the trade war fallout. It tends to favor narratives of dialogue and corrective action, possibly downplaying the structural economic vulnerabilities highlighted by other sources.
