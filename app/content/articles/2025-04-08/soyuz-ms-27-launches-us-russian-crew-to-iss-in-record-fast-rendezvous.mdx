# Soyuz MS-27 Launches US-Russian Crew to ISS in Record Fast Rendezvous

On April 8, 2025, a Soyuz rocket carried NASA astronaut Jonny Kim and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky on a rapid, two-orbit journey to the ISS, marking a significant cooperative milestone.

#### Focusing Facts

- Soyuz MS-27 lifted off from Baikonur Cosmodrome at 1:47 a.m. EDT on April 8, 2025.

- The crew is set to conduct 50 scientific experiments over an approximately eight-month mission aboard the ISS.

- This mission is the first spaceflight for both astronaut Jonny Kim and cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, while Ryzhikov returns for his third ISS stint.

#### Context

Echoing the historic Apollo-Soyuz Test Project of 1975, this launch highlights an enduring, if complex, US-Russian cooperation in space despite geopolitical strains post-2022, and continues a legacy of joint ventures dating back to the Cold War. The mission—notably fast with a three-hour rendezvous—takes place from Baikonur, a site Russia has rented from Kazakhstan since the Soviet era, and is adorned with WWII commemorative imagery, symbolizing resilience and unity. This event, while a standout technical achievement, reinforces long-term interdependence in space exploration that could shape international partnerships for generations, much as earlier collaborative efforts reshaped global space endeavors.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US mainstream science media**: They present the Soyuz launch as a routine yet significant event in international space exploration, emphasizing technical details, mission milestones, and scientific achievements. This framing may understate the broader geopolitical tensions and focuses mainly on the scientific and operational aspects, potentially overlooking the political context.

- **Local political and contextual analysts**: These outlets report the launch in the broader context of US-Russia cooperation amid strained relations, highlighting issues like sanctions, funding troubles, and geopolitical maneuvering. Their narrative may overemphasize the political implications and cast Russia’s space program in a negative light to underscore Western superiority. ([The Peninsula](https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/08/04/2025/soyuz-spacecraft-launches-for-iss-with-american-two-russians), [The Manila times](https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/04/08/world/soyuz-spacecraft-launches-for-iss-with-american-two-russians/2088235))

- **Russian state-influenced media**: They portray the Soyuz mission as a testament to robust US-Russia cooperation and a symbol of easing diplomatic tensions, emphasizing joint projects and collaborative achievements. This perspective may gloss over the challenges facing the Russian space program and downplay the impact of international sanctions to support a narrative of resilience.
