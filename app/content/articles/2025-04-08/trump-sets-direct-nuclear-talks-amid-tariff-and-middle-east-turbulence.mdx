# Trump Sets Direct Nuclear Talks Amid Tariff and Middle East Turbulence

President Trump announced high-level, direct nuclear negotiations with Iran for this Saturday in Oman while upholding aggressive tariffs—including a 17% levy on Israel—even as international experts warn of grave economic and security risks.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump declared direct US-Iran nuclear talks scheduled for Saturday, the first such face-to-face engagement since the 2018 JCPOA withdrawal.

- During an Oval Office meeting with Netanyahu, Trump affirmed existing tariffs, including a 17% rate on Israel, and hinted at broader trade realignments.

- Snapback sanctions on Iran, a key tool under UNSC Resolution 2231, are set to expire on October 18, 2025, intensifying the negotiation urgency.

#### Context

This series of events recalls pivotal moments in international arms control, notably Libya’s 2003 WMD disarmament under intense global pressure, marking a significant, historical recalibration of nuclear policy. The direct talks, emerging after Trump’s unilateral exit from the Obama-era nuclear deal, reflect long-term trends of leveraging economic sanctions and tariff policies as diplomatic tools. Over the next century, such shifts could reshape global power structures and redefine post-Cold War security dynamics, emphasizing the complexities of interweaving economic measures with strategic diplomatic negotiations in a volatile Middle East.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: They emphasize that Iran’s advancing nuclear capabilities make the situation extremely dangerous and insist that tough measures, including possible military options and unilateral sanctions, are necessary to prevent nuclear escalation. This perspective often uses alarmist rhetoric to justify aggressive US policies and underplay diplomatic nuances, potentially increasing support for hardline actions.

- **Left leaning media**: They focus on the uncertainties and inconsistencies in Trump’s approach, stressing that while direct nuclear talks could represent a diplomatic opening, the administration’s aggressive tone and mixed signals pose significant risks. This stance tends to be skeptical of unilateral threats and may downplay the security concerns, favoring diplomatic and multilateral solutions over confrontation.

- **Chinese state influenced media**: They advocate for genuine dialogue by urging the U.S. to demonstrate political sincerity in its negotiations with Iran, critiquing the use of force and unilateral pressure. This view is likely shaped by China’s interest in promoting multilateral diplomacy and countering U.S. assertiveness, hence it downplays American threats in favor of a more conciliatory tone.
