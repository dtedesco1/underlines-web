# Moscow Hosts Trilateral Nuclear Consultations Amid Escalating US-Iran Tensions

On April 7-8, 2025, Russia, China, and Iran initiated closed-door expert-level consultations in Moscow regarding Iran's nuclear program, as the US under President Trump threatened military action.

#### Focusing Facts

- Russia, China, and Iran began expert consultations in Moscow on April 7, 2025.

- US President Donald Trump threatened to bomb Iran unless a nuclear agreement was reached.

- Indirect US-Iran nuclear talks via mediators are scheduled in Oman for April 12, 2025.

#### Context

This event echoes Cold War-era nuclear brinksmanship reminiscent of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when super-power rivalries nearly led to catastrophic conflict. The Moscow consultations, set against a backdrop of US threats and shifting alliances following Russia’s bolstering ties with Iran since its 2022 Ukraine actions, reflect a long-standing pattern of nuclear diplomacy intertwined with geopolitical maneuvering. Over a century, the persistent oscillation between brinkmanship and diplomatic de-escalation in nuclear affairs has shaped international order, and while this moment carries tactical significance, it is only one phase in an evolving, century-spanning strategic contest.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western-oriented media**: These articles emphasize the backdrop of US belligerence, notably highlighting President Trump's bomb threat in the context of the consultations on Iran’s nuclear program, while portraying Russia’s involvement as a potential check on escalating tensions. They may underscore U.S. aggression and cast Russia’s diplomatic moves in a more opportunistic light, aligning with narratives common in Western media critiques of Kremlin influence.

- **Kremlin-aligned and diplomacy-supportive media**: These sources stress that the planned consultations and ties, including talks in Oman, offer a welcome chance to ease tensions and support a diplomatic resolution, echoing Kremlin messaging. They tend to downplay U.S. provocations and reinforce narratives that legitimize Russian diplomatic efforts, aligning closely with the Kremlin’s interests.
