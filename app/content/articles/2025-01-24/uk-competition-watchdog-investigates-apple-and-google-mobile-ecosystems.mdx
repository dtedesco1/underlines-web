# UK Competition Watchdog Investigates Apple and Google Mobile Ecosystems

The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched investigations into Apple and Google's mobile platforms under the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC) to assess potential strategic market status.

#### Focusing Facts

- The CMA's investigations could result in the designation of Apple and Google as having 'Strategic Market Status', allowing enforceable regulatory changes.

- The CMA will complete its investigations by October 22, 2025, leveraging its new regulatory powers under the DMCC Act.

- Both companies hold over 99% of the mobile OS market in the UK, with Android at 51.9% and iOS at 47.7%.

#### Context

The investigation by the UK's CMA into Apple's and Google's mobile ecosystems echoes the historical regulatory scrutiny faced by tech giants in cases like Microsoft's antitrust battles in the late 1990s. This aligns with a broader, long-term trend of increased governmental oversight intended to curb the monopolistic practices of major tech companies. The new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act reflects a significant shift in regulatory posture, reminiscent of the Sherman Antitrust Act's introduction in 1890, which similarly set the stage for addressing market concentration. On a century-long scale, this could mark a pivotal shift towards more balanced control between tech giants and regulatory bodies, potentially leading to long-term changes in how technology companies operate globally, possibly altering the competitive landscape and fostering innovation by lowering market entry barriers for other players.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: The UK's investigation into Apple and Google is seen as a necessary regulatory check on big tech to enhance competition and foster innovation. This group emphasizes government intervention as beneficial, possibly downplaying concerns of overregulation stifling economic growth.

- **Right leaning media**: The CMA investigation into Apple and Google is perceived as a mechanism that might hinder business growth due to overregulation. This perspective might exaggerate economic threats to argue against regulatory oversight, protecting corporate financial interests.

- **Tech-focused media**: The investigation is viewed mainly as a procedural action under new rules, with a neutral tone focusing on consumer impact and competition dynamics. There's a tendency to understate potential long-term impacts on user choice by maintaining a tech-optimistic stance.
