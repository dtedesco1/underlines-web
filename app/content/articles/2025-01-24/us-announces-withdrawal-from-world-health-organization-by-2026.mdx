# US Announces Withdrawal from World Health Organization by 2026

President Donald Trump officially notified the UN of the US withdrawal from WHO, effective January 22, 2026, marking a significant shift in global health diplomacy.

#### Focusing Facts

- The US contributes approximately 18% of WHO's funding, essential for its $6.8 billion budget.

- Withdrawal requires a one-year notice and settlement of dues as per a 1948 US Congress resolution.

- The US's withdrawal announcement comes just days after Trump's inauguration for a second term on January 20, 2025.

#### Context

The US's decision to withdraw from the WHO echoes historical precedents like the US withdrawal from the League of Nations post-WWI, emphasizing a retreat from multilateralism. This move reflects broader global trends of skepticism towards international institutions that have been growing since the late 20th century, potentially altering global health governance profoundly. On a centennial scale, the structural impact of US absence from major global collaborations could significantly reshape international relations and public health frameworks across the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **American mainstream media**: The US mainstream media generally reports on the withdrawal with a focus on its implications for global health programs and America's financial role in the WHO, often highlighting financial contributions and potential disruptions to programs like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS treatments. Some outlets may amplify the narrative of Trump's controversial decision, potentially interpreting his actions as isolationist or detrimental to global cooperation, without explicitly exploring the WHO's mistakes.

- **Asian media**: Asian outlets, such as The Straits Times and AsiaOne, echo the US media narrative but emphasize the disruption of global health initiatives and regional implications, specifically addressing concerns from experts inside and outside the WHO. These outlets might emphasize the potential risks to Asia's health systems, given regional dependencies on WHO programs, to underline their geopolitical standpoint towards US actions.

- **Financial and global news platforms**: Global financial news sources like ThePrint cover the withdrawal with a concentration on America's financial impact on the WHO budget and the administrative fallout of reallocating personnel and finding partners to take over US roles. Financial platforms might narrowly concentrate on economic impacts and organizational logistics over broader public health implications, reflecting a delineation that aligns with fiscal interests.
