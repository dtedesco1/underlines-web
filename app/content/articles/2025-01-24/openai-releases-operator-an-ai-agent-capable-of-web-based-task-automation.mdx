# OpenAI Releases Operator, an AI Agent Capable of Web-Based Task Automation

OpenAI has launched Operator, an autonomous AI agent, on January 23, 2025, capable of booking reservations and purchasing products online, initially available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers in the U.S.

#### Focusing Facts

- Operator launched on January 23, 2025, and is available for ChatGPT Pro users in the U.S., costing $200 monthly.

- Operator can perform web-based tasks autonomously but requires human confirmation for transactions.

- Operator scores 38.1% on OSWorld benchmark, below the human score of 72.4%.

#### Context

The launch of Operator follows a familiar pattern in technological advancement, reminiscent of the early stages of the personal computer era in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During that period, companies like Apple and IBM transformed how people interacted with data, leading to widespread adoption of PCs. Similarly, OpenAI's release of Operator reflects a broader trend towards integrating AI into daily life, aiming to lighten repetitive digital tasks. However, while the explosion of personal computing brought unexpected privacy and security challenges, the introduction of AI agents like Operator amplifies these concerns exponentially given the data access these systems require. On a 100-year timescale, the integration of AI agents could potentially redefine workforce structures, efficiency metrics, and personal productivityâ€”paralleling the industrial revolutions in terms of societal impact. These developments emphasize the importance of establishing strong ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks for AI technology.
