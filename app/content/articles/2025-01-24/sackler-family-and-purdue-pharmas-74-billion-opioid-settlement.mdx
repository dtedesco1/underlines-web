# Sackler Family and Purdue Pharma's $7.4 Billion Opioid Settlement

The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement to resolve litigation over their role in the US opioid crisis, marking a $1 billion increase from a prior settlement rejected by the Supreme Court.

#### Focusing Facts

- The settlement requires the Sackler family to pay $6.5 billion and Purdue Pharma to pay $900 million over 15 years.

- The new settlement terminates the Sackler family's control of Purdue and bars them from selling opioids in the US.

- The settlement still requires U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval and involves over a dozen state attorneys general.

#### Context

The ongoing litigation over opioid accountability reflects historical patterns of drug crises in the US, such as the tobacco settlements of the late 1990s, which saw major companies pay $206 billion over 25 years. The Sackler settlement underscores long-term trends in public health accountability, corporate liability, and the enduring challenge of managing addiction crises. On a 100-year timescale, this event illustrates a shift towards more comprehensive efforts to hold corporations accountable for widespread public health impacts but also highlights the persistence of pharmaceutical influence and complex legal settlements. While the settlement brings significant financial restitution to impacted communities, it begs deeper questions about the systemic reforms needed in regulatory practices and pharmaceutical ethics to prevent future crises.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: They emphasize the significance of the Sacklers' substantial payout and loss of control over Purdue as a step towards accountability in the opioid crisis. They may amplify the narrative of corporate greed to appeal to readers concerned with social justice and regulatory actions, showing less focus on the potential complications of the settlement.

- **Local news**: Local news highlights the financial impact of the settlement on states and emphasizes the relief funds for opioid crisis recovery. They may focus more on the benefit to local communities to highlight the state's role in achieving justice, rather than scrutinizing the complexities of the settlement's execution. ([Boston Herald](https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/01/23/mass-could-see-100m-in-new-opioid-settlement/), [Austin American-Statesman](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/healthcare/2025/01/23/purdue-pharma-settlement-update-texas-lawsuit-opioid-oxycontin/77907477007/))

- **Right leaning media**: They highlight the end of Purdue Pharmaâ€™s operations as a victory over corporate malpractice, focusing on the Sacklers' role in fueling the opioid epidemic. Their focus might be to paint a picture of moral downfall for liberal elites, possibly downplaying the broader systemic issues in pharmaceutical regulation and healthcare policy.
