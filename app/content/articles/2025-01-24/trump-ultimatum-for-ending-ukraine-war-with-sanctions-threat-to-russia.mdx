# Trump Ultimatum for Ending Ukraine War with Sanctions Threat to Russia

President Donald Trump has threatened Russia with new taxes, tariffs, and sanctions unless Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to negotiate an end to the ongoing war in Ukraine.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump made the threat three days into his term as the new US President on January 22, 2025.

- Russia occupies nearly 20% of Ukrainian territory amidst a war lasting almost three years.

- The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, insists on US military involvement in any peacekeeping force.

#### Context

Historically, American presidential attempts to resolve international conflicts via economic pressure have been a mixed bag. For example, during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, economic sanctions played a role, but direct negotiations were key. Trump's threats echo a long-standing trend of using economic tools as leverage in international diplomacy, though similar sanctions under the Biden administration have not ended the conflict. In the long-term, Russia's territorial ambitions and geopolitical strategies remain significant, much as they were during cold-war tensions. This moment could set a precedent for US-Russia relations and international diplomacy, influencing global power dynamics for years to come, but its immediate effectiveness remains uncertain.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left-leaning media**: Outlets like MSNBC and NPR emphasize Trump's failure to fulfill his promises of swiftly ending the Ukraine conflict, highlighting that his proposed sanctions are largely what has already been done by the Biden administration. This group tends to spotlight Trump's inconsistencies and broken promises, possibly due to a historically critical stance towards his policies and statements, especially considering his previous administration's controversies.

- **Right-leaning media**: Sources like Fox News and Breitbart focus on Trump's proactive stance toward negotiations and his attempt to 'make a deal' with Putin to end the war, framing it as a distinctive approach compared to the previous administration. This group might portray Trump's actions in a positive light to emphasize a stark difference from the Biden administration, potentially aligning with right-wing preferences of negotiating strength and unilateral action.

- **Mainstream media**: The BBC and Reuters underline Trump's threats of new sanctions and tariffs as a continuation of existing Western pressure on Russia, noting his claims about negotiating peace where previous efforts under Biden aimed at military and economic solutions. Mainstream outlets might aim to present a balanced view by reporting on the continuities and differences between administrations, though they could be perceived as maintaining establishment perspectives rooted in diplomatic and economic strategies common in prior administrations.
