# Ceasefire Between Israel and Hamas Amid Extensive Destruction in Gaza

A ceasefire was implemented between Israel and Hamas after a 15-month conflict that left 69% of Gaza's infrastructure destroyed and over 47,000 Palestinian fatalities.

#### Focusing Facts

- Over 50 million tons of debris in Gaza will take 21 years to clear, costing $1.2 billion.

- The conflict resulted in over 47,000 Palestinian deaths and 1,200 Israeli casualties.

- 90% of Gaza's population, nearly 1.9 million people, are displaced from their homes.

#### Context

The ceasefire in Gaza echoes past temporary truces that have often faltered, such as the 2014 ceasefire during the Gaza War, which lasted just seven weeks before hostilities resumed. Historically, ceasefires in this conflict often serve as temporary respites rather than enduring peace solutions. This points to a broader trend of cyclical violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, reminiscent of the entrenched geopolitical struggles seen in regions like the Korean Peninsula. The extensive destruction in Gaza highlights the ongoing humanitarian and recovery challenges that have persisted for decades, reminiscent of post-World War II reconstruction efforts, yet within a fraught geopolitical climate. The current moment is significant on a century-long scale as it underscores the entrenched, unresolved issues between statehood, territorial rights, and international diplomacy, drawing attention to the systemic inequities and the need for more sustainable conflict resolution mechanisms beyond mere military cessation.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: These articles express a critical stance towards Israel's military actions in Gaza, highlighting the substantial humanitarian crisis faced by Palestinians and accusing Israel of war crimes and genocide. This perspective might emphasize the scale of destruction and civilian casualties to criticize Israeli policies, potentially downplaying the role of Hamas or the complexities of the conflict.

- **Right leaning media**: The articles from this group support Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas and criticize the perceived imbalance in the exchange of hostages and prisoners between Israel and Hamas. Such a perspective may downplay Palestinian suffering and emphasize negative aspects of Hamas to justify Israeli military actions and policies.

- **Pro-Palestinian activist outlets**: These outlets focus on the need for international intervention to end what they describe as ongoing genocide and apartheid policies by Israel against Palestinians, and express distrust towards ceasefire negotiations. They tend to portray Israel as the aggressor and might overlook the provocations or acts of violence committed by Hamas that are part of the conflict dynamics.
