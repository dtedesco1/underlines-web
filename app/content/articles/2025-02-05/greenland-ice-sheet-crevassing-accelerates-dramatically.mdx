# Greenland Ice Sheet Crevassing Accelerates Dramatically

A study reveals Greenland's ice sheet developed significantly larger and deeper crevasses from 2016 to 2021, indicating faster ice loss and potential sea-level rise.

#### Focusing Facts

- The crevasse volume increased by over 25% in certain sectors between 2016 and 2021.

- Greenland's ice sheet has contributed 14mm to global sea level rise since 1992.

- The overall ice sheet crevasse volume increased by 4.3%, offset by Sermeq Kujalleq's temporary slowdown.

#### Context

This event epitomizes the ongoing response of Greenland's ice sheet to warming, mirroring historical rapid ice losses like those in the last interglacial period (around 130,000 to 115,000 years ago) which saw dramatic rises in sea levels. It reflects the increasing sensitivity of polar ice to global temperatures and illustrates emerging feedback loops that accelerate climate impacts. Viewing this through a hundred-year lens, the significance lies in its stark warning for future generationsâ€”the potential for several meters of sea-level rise poses unprecedented challenges, comparable to climatic shocks that reshaped civilizations after the Last Glacial Maximum roughly 20,000 years ago. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anticipating the full scope of future climate scenarios.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: Climate change is accelerating the breakdown of the Greenland ice sheet, causing rapid crevasse growth that threatens to contribute significantly to sea level rise. The tone emphasizes urgency, potentially to advocate for immediate climate action, aligning with progressive climate change mitigation agendas which traditionally prioritize environmental concerns.

- **Scientific publication**: The study documents the dynamic changes in Greenland's ice sheet, emphasizing the rapid increase in crevasse size and the potential long-term impacts on sea-level rise. The precise scientific language may obscure the broader, immediate implications for the general public, focusing instead on technical data and long-term projections.

- **Local news**: The Greenland ice sheet's accelerated crevasse expansion is a clear indicator of ongoing climate change, contributing to rising sea levels that threaten coastal regions globally. The focus is often localized, potentially oversimplifying complex global systems to make the issue more relatable to local audiences, possibly downplaying uncertainties in climate projections.
