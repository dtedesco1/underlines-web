# M23 Rebels Seize Goma and Declare Unilateral Ceasefire in the DRC

In late January 2025, M23 rebels, allegedly backed by Rwanda, seized the city of Goma in the DRC, leading to widespread violence and a unilateral ceasefire declaration on February 3, citing humanitarian reasons.

#### Focusing Facts

- At least 900 people were killed in Goma's clashes, with an additional 2,880 injured, according to the WHO and UN reports.

- Around 4,000 prisoners escaped from Goma's Munzenze prison during the chaos, while the women's wing was set ablaze resulting in numerous deaths.

- M23's ceasefire comes ahead of a crisis meeting between Congolese and Rwandan leaders in Tanzania.

#### Context

The seizure of Goma by M23 in January 2025 draws historical parallels to their brief capture of the city in 2012, highlighting the recurring instability in the region. This crisis underscores the long-standing ethnic and political tensions in eastern DRC, exacerbated by the mingling of regional actors with vested interests in the mineral wealth of the area. Such patterns recall the longstanding legacy of proxy warfare in Africa, where neighboring countries utilize rebel groups to exert influence, reminiscent of the Angolan and Mozambican conflicts in the 1970s and 80s. On a century-long timescale, the current events may be seen as a continuation of the unresolved colonial legacies and artificial borders that have plagued the continent, raising questions about national sovereignty and regional security dynamics. This moment matters as it may define the ongoing negotiations and peace-building efforts in the Great Lakes region, influencing future governance and regional cooperation.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: M23 rebels and Rwandan troops have caused significant human rights atrocities in Goma, including widespread sexual violence, and there is skepticism about Rwanda's claims of non-involvement. The emphasis on Rwanda's malign involvement may stem from a broader critique of authoritarian regimes and international human rights abuses, highlighting potential double standards in global politics.

- **Right leaning media**: The M23 group's ceasefire in eastern Congo is a pragmatic decision linked to complex regional politics and humanitarian concerns rather than pure aggression. This perspective might downplay the atrocities committed to frame the ceasefire as a diplomatic and necessary step, aligning with narratives of foreign policy realism.

- **South African media**: Rwanda's backing of the M23 rebels is undermining South Africa's peacekeeping efforts and broader regional stability, revealing the challenges posed by authoritarian regimes like Kagame's. The emphasis on Rwanda's actions could reflect nationalistic sentiments and a focus on the losses suffered by South African troops, potentially overemphasizing South Africa's moral high ground.
