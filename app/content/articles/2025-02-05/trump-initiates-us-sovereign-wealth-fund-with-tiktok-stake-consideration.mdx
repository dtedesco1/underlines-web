# Trump Initiates U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund with TikTok Stake Consideration

On February 3, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to establish the U.S.'s first sovereign wealth fund, proposing it might involve a stake in TikTok.

#### Focusing Facts

- The fund's establishment relies on monetizing U.S. government assets worth $5.7 trillion.

- The proposed sovereign wealth fund aims to be operational within 12 months.

- Trump delayed a TikTok ban, suggesting a joint venture involving the app and the sovereign wealth fund.

#### Context

The establishment of a U.S. sovereign wealth fund is a monumental shift in U.S. economic strategy, echoing historical initiatives like the 1933 New Deal which sought to manage economic recovery post-Great Depression. While countries like Norway, Saudi Arabia, and China have successfully managed massive sovereign wealth funds, the U.S. doing so under significant national debt raises questions about feasibility and priorities. Over a 100-year horizon, this move could redefine U.S. economic leverage and redistributive mechanisms if managed effectively but also encapsulate risk of politicization and corruption, reminiscent of the 1MDB scandal. Scaling to match existing global funds could profoundly impact U.S. financial hegemony or be a cautionary tale of overreach.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream media**: The mainstream media presents Trump's creation of a sovereign wealth fund as a strategic move to monetize U.S. assets and possibly purchase TikTok, highlighting the administration's plan to generate wealth for American citizens. This group may emphasize the potential economic benefits while downplaying risks, aiming for a neutral or balanced viewpoint to appeal to a wide audience.

- **Right leaning media**: Right-leaning media portrays the establishment of the sovereign wealth fund as Trump fulfilling a campaign promise to boost economic development, portraying it as a triumph for American sovereignty and innovation. This perspective may overlook potential governance risks or the national debt, framing the initiative in a wholly positive light aligned with Trump's policy agenda.

- **Analytical or financial media**: Analytical media such as CNBC offer a detailed overview of the practical implications of the sovereign wealth fund, discussing its feasibility and economic impact. This group may focus heavily on technical and economic analysis, potentially underestimating political ramifications or public sentiment.
