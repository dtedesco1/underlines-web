# Trump Pauses 25% Tariffs on Canada and Mexico Amid Border Enforcement Deals

President Trump temporarily suspended tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after securing commitments on border security and anti-drug measures.

#### Focusing Facts

- Canada agreed to a $1.3 billion border plan, including appointing a Fentanyl Czar and deploying 10,000 personnel.

- Mexico pledged to send 10,000 troops to strengthen its northern border to avoid tariffs.

- The 10% tariff on Chinese imports took effect without delay on February 4, 2025.

#### Context

This event mirrors earlier trade negotiations, such as the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which intensified the Great Depression by sparking tit-for-tat tariffs globally. The current situation reflects a broader trend of protectionism that marks a shift from the globalization era of the 1990s and 2000s. Trump's actions signify a focus on border security and addressing the opioid crisis through economic means, echoing past US policies that link trade and security. The long-term significance may depend on whether such measures effectively curb drug trafficking without destabilizing trade relations, similar to containment strategies against substances in the 1980s. Over a century, this could either represent a temporary policy phase or a shift towards enduring economic nationalism and securitized trade policies.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: Trump's tariff moves are seen as impulsive and ineffective, with potential risks for economic damage. This perspective may downplay any strategic advantages of tariffs, focusing instead on negative impacts, appealing to an audience critical of Trump's policies.

- **Right leaning media**: Trump's tariff strategy demonstrates a strong stance on securing national borders and protecting American industries. This view may exaggerate the effectiveness of tariffs and border enhancements, catering to nationalist sentiments and support for strong immigration policies.

- **Chinese state owned media**: The reciprocal tariff measures are a necessary response to US provocations and highlight the importance of safeguarding national sovereignty. This perspective often portrays China as a victim of foreign aggression, appealing to Chinese nationalism and support for the government's foreign policy maneuvers.
