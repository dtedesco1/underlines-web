# Trump's Tariff Hikes Deepen WTO Paralysis Amid Trade Disputes

Trump's 10% tariff increase on Chinese goods prompts China's retaliatory measures and complaint to the already paralyzed WTO.

#### Focusing Facts

- China filed a WTO complaint over Trump's new 10% tariffs on February 4, 2025.

- The WTO's Appellate Body has been non-functional since December 2019 due to US blocking appointments.

- 32 WTO dispute rulings are currently in limbo due to the Appellate Body impasse.

#### Context

The current deadlock at the WTO is reminiscent of trade tensions during the Smoot-Hawley Tariff era in 1930, which deepened global economic woes. The ongoing inability of the WTO to resolve disputes due to the US blockade of Appellate Body appointments reflects long-term trends of US disengagement from multilateral institutions, similar to its stance towards the League of Nations post-World War I. This event matters significantly on a century-long timeline, highlighting the fragility of the global trade system when major powers opt for unilateral action over diplomacy. A crippled WTO undermines the very institution created to stabilize post-war economic cooperation, risking further destabilization in international trade relations.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: The US is blamed for paralysing the WTO's dispute resolution mechanism, with a critical stance towards Trump's use of tariffs against China. This perspective may overlook China's reciprocal actions and focus critiquing US policy, possibly aligning with a broader critique of Trump's international strategies.

- **Mainstream media**: Both US and previous administrations share responsibility for the WTO's current state; the trade tensions between the US and China are emphasized over specific blame. By spreading the responsibility among various administrations, this perspective might dilute the focus on current policies, suggesting a more balanced but less direct stance.
