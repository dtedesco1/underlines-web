# Zelenskyy Criticizes US-Russia Talks and Reveals Missing Ukraine Aid

Zelenskyy warns of the dangers of being excluded from US-Russia talks and discloses only receiving $76 billion of the $177 billion US aid approved for Ukraine.

#### Focusing Facts

- Ukraine received $76 billion out of $177 billion US aid approved.

- Trump's administration is holding talks with Russia and Ukraine about ending the war.

- Trump proposes a deal linking US aid to Ukraine's rare earth resources.

#### Context

This event echoes historical concerns over foreign intervention and the opacity of international aid. The exclusion of Ukraine from peace talks is reminiscent of the Munich Agreement of 1938, where Czechoslovakia was left out of decisions about its fate, leading to its dismemberment. The discrepancy in aid underscores a longstanding issue of accountability in foreign aid, akin to controversies surrounding U.S. aid during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s. This situation highlights a global trend towards resource-based diplomacy, as seen with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Over the next century, this moment could signify a shift towards increased transparency and accountability demands globally in military and humanitarian aid.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: Right-leaning media, such as Fox News and PJ Media, are highlighting President Trump's role in engaging with Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict, emphasizing the notion that Trump's strategy could bring an end to the war. This group tends to portray Trump's actions as strong and effective while downplaying or questioning the Biden administration's contribution. They highlight discrepancies in U.S. aid to Ukraine as a potential mismanagement or corruption angle, suggesting issues with the Biden administration.

- **Left leaning media**: Left-leaning media, such as The Guardian, focuses on the potential dangers of excluding Ukraine from peace talks, emphasizing Zelenskyy's warnings and the moral implications of such actions. This group's perspective often criticizes unilateral actions by U.S. leaders that may undermine Ukrainian sovereignty, possibly highlighting moral and ethical concerns over geopolitical strategies.

- **Ukrainian media**: Ukrainian media like Українська правда is pressing the narrative of Ukraine's received aid discrepancy, warning both local and international audiences about the potential shortfall in the military aid that the U.S. reportedly allocated. This view may emphasize Ukraine's ongoing struggle and resilience in the war, likely aiming to rally international support and sympathy for more consistent aid and highlighting successes in defending independence.
