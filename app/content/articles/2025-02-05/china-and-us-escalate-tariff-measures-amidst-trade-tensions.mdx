# China and US Escalate Tariff Measures Amidst Trade Tensions

A new round of tariffs has been imposed by both the US and China, with the US imposing a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods effective February 4, 2025, and China retaliating with up to 15% tariffs on various American products starting February 10, 2025.

#### Focusing Facts

- US imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese goods on February 4, 2025.

- China retaliated with tariffs starting February 10, 2025, which included a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas.

- China announced an antitrust investigation into Google as part of its countermeasures.

#### Context

The current trade skirmishes between the U.S. and China are reminiscent of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, where protective tariffs led to retaliations that exacerbated the Great Depression. Historically, such protectionist measures often spiral into wider trade wars, as seen in past decades. The latest imposition of tariffs reflects a persistent tit-for-tat strategy reminiscent of the earlier U.S.-China trade war during Trump's first presidency (2018-2020). This moment arguably signifies a critical juncture in both countries' efforts to redefine global trade dynamics, echoing an era of shifting alliances reminiscent of the early 20th century, potentially influencing economic trajectories for the upcoming century. While geopolitical cycles see repeated tensions, the expanding role of China as a dominant economic player and a stabilizing force in other regions suggests a far-reaching shift in economic structures. Whether this event leads to a persistent decoupling or fosters new negotiations will resonate well into the future.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: Beijing is potentially being seen as the 'good cop' in maintaining a stable trade environment amid Trump's tariff impositions, while the U.S. risks undermining its international stance. There may be a tendency to highlight China's restraint and diplomatic approach in an attempt to critique Trump's aggressive trade stance, potentially downplaying the negative impacts of China's response.

- **Right leaning media**: Trumpâ€™s tariffs are depicted as a necessary defense against drug trafficking from China, and China's reaction is seen as an inevitable but secondary concern. There's a focus on portraying Trump's policies as justified and necessary, possibly minimizing the economic fallout of a trade war and China's leverage in the situation.

- **Chinese state owned media**: The tariffs are depicted as a violation of international rules and an unjustified act of trade protectionism by Trump, with China portrayed as defending its national interests. Emphasis is placed on portraying the U.S. as the aggressor while highlighting China's legal and measured response, potentially glossing over any aggressive or provocative actions by China itself.
