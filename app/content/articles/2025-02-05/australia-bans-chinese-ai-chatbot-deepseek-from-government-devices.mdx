# Australia Bans Chinese AI Chatbot DeepSeek from Government Devices

Australia has officially banned the Chinese AI Chatbot DeepSeek from federal government systems, effective immediately, due to national security concerns.

#### Focusing Facts

- The ban requires the removal of all DeepSeek products from government devices, with compliance reporting mandated.

- DeepSeek's AI Chatbot, launched in January 2025, was downloaded over a million times and caused a $1 trillion hit to the US tech index.

- Similar bans have been enacted by Italy, Taiwan, and the US state of Texas, citing security concerns.

#### Context

The banning of DeepSeek echoes past events, such as when Australia banned TikTok from government devices in 2023 amid similar data security fears. This reflects broader global apprehensions about Chinese technology and data privacy, evidencing growing scrutiny over the decades. The acceleration of international bans and the financial impact highlight an urgent need for nations to balance technological innovation with national security. On a centennial timeline, these bans may signify an early stage in a more stringent global regulation of AI technologies, much like historic regulatory pivots in technology data privacy post-2000s or financial regulation post-1929 crash, affecting global AI development and geopolitical tech dynamics.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: They interpret Australia's ban on DeepSeek as a swift, decisive action against security risks posed by AI technologies irrespective of their country of origin. While emphasizing a country-agnostic approach, the coverage leaves out potential geopolitical tensions and assumes the government is purely motivated by national security, ignoring economic or political considerations.

- **Right leaning media**: They view the ban on DeepSeek as a necessary measure to counteract potential threats from Chinese technology firms, framing it as a defense of national integrity against foreign influence. This perspective focuses on the potential threat posed by Chinese companies, potentially aggravating anti-China sentiments and overlooking the technological competition and market dynamics involved.

- **Local news**: Local news presents the ban as part of a broader global reaction to emerging security threats from Chinese AI, suggesting cautious use of AI technologies. These sources may overly depend on official statements and do not necessarily challenge government views, remaining more descriptive than analytical about government policy decisions.
