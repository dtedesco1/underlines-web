# OpenAI and Kakao Announce AI Partnership Amid Altman's South Korea Visit

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman formally announced a collaboration with South Korea's Kakao to develop AI products, while also meeting with major semiconductor companies in Seoul.

#### Focusing Facts

- Sam Altman officially announced the partnership with Kakao on February 4, 2025, in Seoul.

- Altman's visit included meetings with executives from Samsung and SK hynix to discuss AI technologies and semiconductor collaboration.

- OpenAI's partnership with Kakao follows a similar collaboration with Japan's SoftBank, announced earlier in the same week.

#### Context

In a rapidly evolving tech landscape, Sam Altman's strategic partnerships in Asia reflect a significant shift toward collaborative globalization in AI development. Historically, such alliances are reminiscent of the post-WWII era when multinational corporations, like IBM, entered rapidly industrializing nations to capitalize on technological growth. Now, Altman's traditional Western-centric approach is diversifying, tapping into East Asia's robust semiconductor and tech industries. While the immediate impacts may focus on commercial advantage and AI integration, the long-term implications suggest a deeper entwining of global technological infrastructures which could redefine the industry over the next century. This collaboration highlights a pivotal moment in AI history, potentially setting the stage for groundbreaking advancements and highlighting the importance of strategic international alliances in the context of increasing global competition, particularly with emerging players like China's DeepSeek.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Korean industry-focused media**: OpenAI's partnerships in Korea, especially with companies like Kakao and potential meetings with giants like Samsung, underscore the strategic importance of Korean tech firms in the global AI landscape. Their reports may reflect national pride and emphasize the benefits to local companies and the Korean economy, potentially downplaying any risks or challenges these partnerships might bring.

- **International business media**: OpenAI's strategic partnerships, particularly in Asia, signal its aggressive expansion strategy and its adaptability in forming alliances to stay competitive, especially against rising rivals like China's DeepSeek.
