# EU Commences Enforcement of AI Act Amid Global Tech Tensions

The EU officially begins enforcing its AI Act, with impactful bans on specific AI applications now active, despite opposition from Trump over effects on US companies.

#### Focusing Facts

- The AI Act bans real-time facial recognition systems and categorization by attributes.

- Fines for non-compliance can reach 35 million euros or 7% of global annual turnover.

- Donald Trump threatened retaliation against the EU for imposing legislative hurdles on US tech companies.

#### Context

The EU's ambitious AI Act represents a significant regulatory milestone, reminiscent of Europe's 2018 GDPR, which set global privacy standards. The AI Act's stringent regulations follow a trend of increasing global skepticism about AI's potential risks, echoing various historical regulatory interventions aimed at balancing innovation with ethical considerationsâ€”like the UK's 1865 Red Flag Act applied to automobiles. The current geopolitical glance, with the US expressing concern, highlights historical tensions typical of regulatory divergence between major economic powers (similar trade tensions seen in the 20th century). On a century-scale, the enforcement marks a critical juncture in digital governance, potentially influencing international standards and shaping the balance of AI development between ethical concerns and technological progression.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: The Guardian expresses concern over the potential suffering of AI systems if they become conscious, advocating for research guidelines to prevent mistreatment. Their focus on the ethical implications of AI consciousness might be driven by a broader agenda to regulate tech industry practices more strictly.

- **Business and tech industry media**: Forbes and CNBC highlight the role of AI as a career-enhancing tool, suggesting that AI can significantly empower individuals in professional settings. Their optimistic portrayal of AI's impact on career advancement might overlook potential job displacement issues.
