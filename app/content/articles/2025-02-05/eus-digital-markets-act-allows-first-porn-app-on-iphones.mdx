# EU's Digital Markets Act Allows First Porn App on iPhones

The Digital Markets Act led to a third-party app marketplace, AltStore PAL, releasing the first pornographic app, Hot Tub, for iPhones in the EU.

#### Focusing Facts

- Hot Tub became available on iPhones in the EU through AltStore PAL on February 3, 2025.

- AltStore PAL gets financial support from Epic Games, often at odds with Apple's policies.

- The EU's Digital Markets Act came into effect in 2024, mandating alternative app store options for iOS in the region.

#### Context

The controversy surrounding the Hot Tub app on iPhones mirrors past technological and cultural shifts where regulatory changes altered established tech ecosystems, akin to the Microsoft antitrust case in the late 1990s. The introduction of the Digital Markets Act reflects a growing global trend towards limiting monopolistic practices by major tech companies, pressing them to embrace more open architectures. This moment signifies a potential watershed in tech regulation, echoing shifts like the breakup of AT&T in 1982, as it empowers consumers with greater choice. Over a century, such acts could transform the tech landscape, challenging Apple's famed walled garden ecosystem that has been a hallmark since the iPhone's debut in 2007, fostering a climate more open to competition and diverse app innovation.
