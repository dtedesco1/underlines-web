# USPS Suspends Parcel Services from China amid Trump's Tariff Implementation

The USPS halted acceptance of parcels from China and Hong Kong as Trump's tariffs eliminate duty-free exemptions.

#### Focusing Facts

- USPS stopped accepting parcels from China and Hong Kong on February 5, 2025.

- Trump's executive order ended the 'de minimis' rule on February 3, 2025, affecting parcels under $800.

- Shein and Temu, major users of the rule, accounted for 30% of affected parcels.

#### Context

The suspension of parcels by the USPS echoes past trade tensions, notably the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which exacerbated the Great Depression by boosting trade barriers. It highlights ongoing global trade frictions, especially between the US and China, emphasizing a shift towards more protectionist policies. This specific moment reflects a growing distrust in free trade mechanisms, echoing earlier eras of economic nationalism. Over a century, these actions may reveal a pivotal shift towards nationalism versus globalization, reminiscent of interwar protectionism. Understanding this event requires skepticism about its long-term efficacy in achieving intended economic objectives, particularly given the global economy's intricate web of interdependencies, which differ markedly from those in the early 20th century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: The USPS suspension of parcels from China is tied to President Trump's trade war tactics, depicted as hasty and potentially damaging to international relations and the economic market. This outlook might emphasize the negative results of the Trump trade policies, focusing on economic disruption to align with their frequent criticism of Trump's administration.

- **Right leaning media**: The suspension is an enforcement of Trump's trade policies to close risks posed by loopholes like the de minimis rule, which allow unfair competition from Chinese retailers. The emphasis may lie on justifying the trade policies as protective of American interests, which aligns with the publication's inclination to support conservative policies.

- **Local news**: The USPS temporary suspension is a developing situation with simple reporting on the fact, avoiding extensive analysis or political implication association. Coverage likely offers straightforward news, but with little critical engagement or interpretation, reflecting a typical focus on reporting rather than analysis.
