# Welcome to Underlines

This is the inaugural edition of the Underlines newsletter. We're using Markdown (with optional MDX components) so every issue is easy to author, review, and publish.

> The code for this whole page is just markdown
> with a few React components whenever we want more dynamic content.

## In this issue

- A quick tour of the publishing workflow
- How to add MDX components for interactive blocks
- Links to additional resources
