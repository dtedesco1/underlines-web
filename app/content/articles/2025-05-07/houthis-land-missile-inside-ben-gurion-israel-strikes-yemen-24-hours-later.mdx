# Houthis Land Missile Inside Ben Gurion; Israel Strikes Yemen 24 Hours Later

On 4 May 2025 a Yemeni-launched ballistic missile evaded Israel’s Arrow/THAAD shield and detonated inside Ben Gurion Airport’s perimeter, wounding six civilians and forcing a one-hour shutdown of the country’s sole international hub.

#### Focusing Facts

- Impact occurred at 09:22 local time on 4 May 2025; sirens and a new phone alert preceded detonation by ~5 minutes, and flights were halted until 10:20.

- At 19:00 on 5 May 2025, roughly 20 Israeli F-15/16 jets dropped 50 precision munitions on Houthi sites around Hodeidah and Bajil, the IDF’s sixth Yemen strike of the war and first since January.

- Of 27 Houthi ballistic missiles fired at Israel since 18 March, this was the first to penetrate all layers of Israeli defence and reach a populated target zone.

#### Context

A projectile from a non-state actor reaching Israel’s busiest airport echoes the 17 January 1991 Iraqi Scud that struck Tel Aviv, when U.S. Patriots likewise failed to intercept, and the 14 Sept 2019 drone-missile swarm on Saudi Aramco that exposed Gulf air-defence gaps.  The episode underscores a 21st-century trend: inexpensive, Iranian-supplied precision weapons allow proxy militias thousands of kilometres away to threaten strategic infrastructure, eroding the monopoly of state airpower and the credibility of billion-dollar defence umbrellas.  Whether this matters in 2125 depends on escalation cycles now—each tit-for-tat (Israel’s first Yemen strike in four months, Iran’s warnings, U.S. involvement) thickens the informal Israel-Iran shadow war that has gradually migrated from Syria and the Red Sea into direct homeland targets.  Alternatively, if cooler heads revert to limited reprisals, the incident may be remembered like the Gulf War Scuds: alarming but ultimately contained.  Either way, it signals that geographic distance and layered interceptors no longer guarantee sanctuary, a structural shift likely to shape Middle-Eastern deterrence calculations for decades.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli national outlets (e.g., The Times of Israel, The Jerusalem Post)**: Frame the missile strike as Iranian-orchestrated aggression against Israel that warrants a forceful military response, including possible direct action inside Yemen or even against Iran. Close alignment with Israeli security establishment can lead these outlets to amplify government talking points, minimize the Gaza context, and portray retaliation as both necessary and proportionate. ([The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/houthi-missile-hits-grounds-of-ben-gurion-airport-after-interception-fails-6-injured/), [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-852529))

- **Arab/Qatari media (e.g., Al Jazeera Online)**: Portrays the Houthi missile as a retaliatory act tied to Israel’s war on Gaza and the humanitarian siege, stressing the continued U.S./U.K. strikes on Yemen and Palestinian suffering. Coverage often centers Palestinian and Yemeni grievances, which can under-report Israeli civilian fears or the Houthis’ extremist rhetoric, reflecting Qatar’s regional positioning.

- **U.S. right-leaning pro-Israel outlets (e.g., Breitbart, One America News Network, CBN)**: Highlight the attack as proof of Iran’s direct hostility, urging Israel (and the U.S.) to hit back hard and possibly strike Iran itself. Hawkish ideological stance tends to conflate Houthis with Iran wholesale, use alarmist language, and endorse escalation that aligns with conservative foreign-policy preferences.
