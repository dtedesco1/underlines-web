# EU Commission Sets Irrevocable 2027 Cut-Off for Remaining Russian Energy Deals

On 6 May 2025 Brussels released a legal roadmap ordering EU firms to end all spot purchases of Russian fuels in 2025 and terminate every long-term oil, gas and nuclear contract by 31 December 2027.

#### Focusing Facts

- Russian energy still supplied 19 % of EU gas (31.6 bcm pipeline + 20 bcm LNG) and 14 % of uranium in 2024 despite previous sanctions.

- Draft plan lets companies cite EU law as force majeure to exit Gazprom ‘take-or-pay’ contracts, already sparking €18.5 bn in arbitration claims.

- Measure will be adopted via single-market legislation requiring a qualified majority, bypassing the expected vetoes of Hungary and Slovakia.

#### Context

Brussels’ gambit echoes the 1973–74 oil-shock pivot, when Europe hurried to diversify away from OPEC crude and created the IEA, yet many states quietly drifted back once prices stabilised.  Half a century later the same security-of-supply reflex is colliding with decarbonisation, U.S.–EU trade tensions and a possible Ukraine cease-fire that could tempt capitals to seek cheap Russian molecules again.  By weaponising the internal-market rulebook instead of sanctions, the Commission is testing how far pooled sovereignty can stretch over national energy choices—a micro-laboratory for deeper federalisation.  If it sticks, the decision will rewire gas infrastructure, hasten renewables build-out and lock in U.S. LNG demand for decades; if it unravels, it will join earlier forgotten embargoes.  Either outcome will ripple through Europe’s strategic autonomy calculus well into the 22nd century, because great-power wars keep reminding the continent that energy is never just a commodity.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **European centrist media (Financial Times, BBC, Reuters, Euronews)**: They present the EU’s 2027 energy-divorce roadmap as a decisive, necessary move to end Russian leverage over Europe and stop funding Moscow’s war. Coverage generally echoes the European Commission’s narrative and downplays the higher energy costs and contractual headaches emphasised by critics.

- **Business and policy outlets warning of economic risks (POLITICO, Bloomberg)**: Their reporting stresses that the plan faces stiff legal, market and political obstacles, with executives likely to revert to cheap Russian fuel once the political climate allows. By foregrounding corporate anxieties and competitiveness concerns, they tend to amplify industry interests that benefit from continued Russian imports and may underplay the security rationale.

- **Russian state-owned media (TASS)**: It relays the proposal as a Bloomberg rumour, implicitly highlighting that the EU has not yet acted and suggesting the measure is still tentative. By omitting the EU’s security justification and focusing on the plan’s speculative nature, it reinforces Moscow’s narrative that European unity is weak and plans may not materialise.
