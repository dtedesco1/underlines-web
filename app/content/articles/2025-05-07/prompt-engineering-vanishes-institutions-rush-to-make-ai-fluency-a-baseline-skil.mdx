# Prompt Engineering Vanishes: Institutions Rush to Make AI Fluency a Baseline Skill

In the first week of May 2025, companies, universities and media outlets signaled that stand-alone "prompt engineer" jobs are being killed off and replaced by a universal expectation that every student and employee can work directly with generative AI, triggering new training funds and curriculum overhauls.

#### Focusing Facts

- ChatGPT recorded 400 million weekly users in May 2025—OpenAI says the majority are students (CHE, 5 May 2025).

- University of Maryland earmarked $85,000 for seven AI-centric courses and pledged greater than $100 million for its AI institute over 10 years (CBS News, 6 May 2025).

- Fast Company reports firms that once hired prompt engineers now rely on AI to write its own prompts, folding the skill into ordinary roles (6 May 2025).

#### Context

Specialized skills turning into general literacy is a familiar arc: the typing pool of the 1920s shrank once the QWERTY keyboard became ubiquitous, and spreadsheet clerks of the 1980s evaporated when Lotus 1-2-3 came pre-installed on office PCs. The extinction of prompt engineering shows the same pattern—capabilities first reserved for experts rapidly diffuse, propelled here by self-improving models that automate even their own usage. Long-term, this points to a century-scale trend where each wave of automation absorbs a layer of cognitive labor and pushes human advantage toward curiosity, judgment and embodied work. If AI keeps internalizing its own interface the way engines internalized the role of firemen on locomotives after 1900, the strategic differentiator for institutions will be how quickly they convert one-off expertise into broad, adaptable fluency rather than how many niche specialists they hire.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business and tech-industry media (e.g., Forbes, CIO, TechRadar)**: Portray AI as a transformative growth engine that incumbents must rapidly deploy to boost productivity, re-shape organizations and unlock new revenue streams. Because these outlets celebrate deal-making and corporate success, they often minimize social risks and hype startups’ valuations to keep investors, advertisers and executive readers enthusiastic.

- **Mainstream and education-focused commentators warning of disruption (e.g., Washington Post opinion, Chronicle of Higher Education, Fast Company)**: Emphasize that AI is already eroding jobs, academic integrity and professional roles, urging workers and professors to prep or intervene before the technology runs amok. Their cautionary framing can veer toward alarmism that draws clicks and reinforces existing worries while overlooking efficiency gains documented elsewhere. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/06/ai-jobs-prepper/), [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91327911/prompt-engineering-going-extinct))

- **Academic and research-centric coverage (e.g., Phys.org, CBS local education reporting, interviews with scientists)**: Treat AI chiefly as a frontier for scientific inquiry and learning, spotlighting mathematical methods to scrutinize models and new university curricula funded to study the technology. By highlighting research agendas and grant money, they have an incentive to stress the need for continued funding and may underplay commercial constraints or short-term deployment issues.
