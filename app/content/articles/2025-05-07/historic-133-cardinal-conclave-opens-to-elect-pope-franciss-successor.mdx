# Historic 133-Cardinal Conclave Opens to Elect Pope Francis’s Successor

On 7 May 2025, 133 voting cardinals—the largest, most internationally dispersed electorate in Church history—entered seclusion in the Sistine Chapel to begin balloting for the 267th pontiff after Pope Francis’s 21 April death.

#### Focusing Facts

- Of the 133 electors locked in, 108 (≈81%) were elevated to the cardinalate by Francis himself.

- The electorate spans 70 countries across five continents, surpassing the previous record of 115 electors in 2013.

- A late-April update to the Annuario Pontificio quietly altered the birth records of two African cardinals, adding one new eligible voter and raising the potential tally to 135 before illness reduced it back to 133.

#### Context

Twice before—1271 in Viterbo and 1846 in Rome—fractured factions and shifting geopolitics forced the College into marathon deliberations; both moments signalled power migrating away from Italian dynasts toward broader coalitions.  The 2025 conclave sits at a similar inflection: Catholic demography has tilted decisively southward (Africa alone has grown from 45 million faithful in 1975 to over 265 million today), yet Vatican structures still reflect Euro-centric precedents set by Gregory X’s 1274 Ubi periculum.  Francis accelerated that mismatch by naming cardinals from Mongolia to Tonga while limiting in-person synods, so many electors meet each other for the first time only now—raising the odds of a surprise compromise candidate, as in 1958 and 1978.  On a century horizon, this conclave’s significance is less about which individual emerges and more about whether the papacy completes a slow, 19th-to-21st-century transition from a Euro-political prince to a global pastoral broker; the demographic and procedural shifts visible this week suggest that transformation is nearing its tipping point.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: Portray the conclave as historically large and deeply split between progressive and conservative blocs, stressing that cardinals must choose someone able to extend Pope Francis’s reforms and confront abuse scandals. By foregrounding ideological rifts and reformist hopes, coverage can amplify church divisions and cater to audiences that favor progressive change while giving less airtime to traditionalist voices or spiritual themes. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/07/cardinals-begin-choosing-new-pope-conclave), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2de9d8dky0o))

- **Right leaning media**: Casts the gathering as a solemn, orderly ritual centred on prayerful patience and time-honoured procedure, with little speculation about ideological battles. The focus on ceremony and de-emphasis of controversy can shield readers from debates over reform or transparency, aligning with a preference for institutional stability and traditional values.

- **Catholic/Vatican-affiliated media**: Highlights the long, unbroken lineage of conclave rules from the Middle Ages to today, framing the election as a sacred duty anchored in centuries of continuity. Institutional proximity inclines the reporting to stress legitimacy and spiritual heritage while glossing over present-day political maneuvering or criticism of church governance.
