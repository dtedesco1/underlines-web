# Centre Orders 244-District Civil Defence Drill for 7 May, First Since 1971

On 5-6 May, India’s Home Ministry instructed every state to run synchronized civil-defence exercises on 7 May 2025—its first nationwide wartime-style drill in over five decades.

#### Focusing Facts

- Order spans 244 designated civil-defence districts, from Delhi to Maharashtra, with activities timed for 11:00 a.m. on 7 May 2025.

- Previous comparable drill occurred in 1971, the year India fought Pakistan on two fronts.

- Trigger was the 22 Apr 2025 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people and led to 11 consecutive nights of LoC shelling.

#### Context

India last dusted off blackout curtains and air-raid sirens during the 1965 and 1971 wars, when cities such as Calcutta dimmed lights to foil Pakistani bombers; reviving those protocols now signals a state that still sees conventional interstate conflict as plausible even after decades of nuclear deterrence and ‘surgical strike’ doctrines.  The drill fits a global post-9/11 pattern of governments expanding civil-military integration—think the U.S. “Ready Gov” push (2003) or Israel’s annual ‘Turning Point’ exercise (since 2007)—reflecting an era where terrorism, drones and hypersonics blur home-front and battle-front.  Whether this becomes the new normal or a one-off gesture matters: routine civilian mobilisation can, over a century, entrench a security state mindset and divert resources from long-term social infrastructure, yet it can also build resilience against truly systemic shocks.  The fact that New Delhi resurrected a Cold-War-era statute rather than craft a modern civil-protection law hints at institutional path-dependence as much as imminent war.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian television news networks (e.g., NDTV, News18, India TV)**: They present the May 7 civil-defence drills as an extraordinary, historic step driven by sharply escalating India-Pakistan tensions after the Pahalgam terror attack, stressing that nothing similar has happened since the 1971 war. The 24-hour TV format rewards dramatic framing; by highlighting worst-case scenarios and repeatedly invoking 1971 they keep viewers glued and reinforce a government-friendly, tough-on-Pakistan narrative documented in the articles.

- **Business & policy press (e.g., Mint, The Economic Times, The Times of India)**: They report the drills as a precautionary, rules-based preparedness exercise rooted in the Civil Defence Act 1968, emphasising that such mock drills do not necessarily signal an imminent conflict but are sensible risk-management given new security threats. By downplaying the immediacy of war they help reassure investors and preserve market calm—an editorial incentive for outlets whose readership is the corporate and financial community.

- **Local city newspapers (e.g., The Indian Express Pune edition)**: They zoom in on municipal implementation—testing 76 sirens, coordinating with local agencies—and frame the drill chiefly as a logistical public-safety exercise for residents of specific cities like Pune. The hyper-local angle sidelines the broader geopolitical stakes, reflecting a newsroom focus on city readers’ immediate concerns rather than questioning national security rationales.
