# PBOC Rolls Out 50-bp RRR Cut and 10-bp Rate Trim on Eve of New US-China Tariff Talks

Beijing unexpectedly lowered the reserve-requirement ratio by 0.50 pp and cut key policy rates 10 bp on 7 May 2025, its first easing of the year, injecting ¥1 trn liquidity just days before revived high-level trade negotiations with Washington.

#### Focusing Facts

- The 50-basis-point RRR cut will release roughly 1 trillion yuan (≈US$138 bn) into the banking system, dropping the weighted average RRR to 6.2%.

- The seven-day reverse repo and other policy rates fall 10 bp to 1.40% effective 8 May 2025, implying a corresponding 10-bp reduction in the loan prime rate.

- Vice-Premier He Lifeng will meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Switzerland on 9-12 May for the first senior-level talks since tariffs were hiked to 145%.

#### Context

China has long used liquidity jolts when external shocks loom—recall October 2008, when the PBoC slashed the RRR 100 bp and cut rates 27 bp as the global financial crisis hit, or mid-2015 after the stock-market rout.  The latest move sits at the intersection of three structural forces: (1) a debt-heavy, property-centric growth model now sputtering; (2) accelerating Sino-US economic decoupling reminiscent of the 1980s U.S.–Japan trade frictions that culminated in the 1985 Plaza Accord; and (3) China’s gradual shift from brute-force credit easing toward more “targeted” tools—which nonetheless keep re-appearing whenever confidence collapses.  Over a 100-year lens, today’s step is less about a single basis-point tweak than about whether the world’s second-largest economy can sustain high growth without unfettered access to U.S. markets and technology.  If monetary levers keep compensating for shrinking external demand and an ageing workforce, the episode may mark the beginning of a long era in which the PBoC, like the Bank of Japan post-1990, fights ever-diminishing returns from easing while geopolitical rivalry hardens financial blocs.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Chinese and Asia-Pacific regional outlets (Caixin, The Nation Thailand, Malay Mail)**: Present the rate and RRR cuts as a broad, timely policy package intended to cushion China’s economy from U.S. tariffs and rekindle domestic demand by injecting about 1 trillion yuan of liquidity. By largely relaying official statements, they echo Beijing’s narrative of policy competence and gloss over deeper structural weaknesses or political accountability for the slowdown.

- **Western financial press (Reuters, CNBC, Financial Times)**: Describe the easing as a reactive move to shore up growth and liquidity amid an escalating U.S.–China trade war, detailing the 50-bp RRR cut and 10-bp rate trim and its expected market impact. Market-centric coverage can understate social ramifications and assumes monetary tweaks will satisfy investors, mirroring the priorities of global capital markets.

- **Left-leaning Western media (The Guardian)**: Highlight the cuts as evidence of China’s mounting economic stress, quoting analysts who doubt the stimulus will work because the real problem is weak demand and a battered property sector. Focus on vulnerabilities may over-accentuate pessimistic angles to critique both Trump’s tariff strategy and Beijing’s economic management.
