# US Judge Strips Apple’s ‘30% Tax’ and Epic Slashes Its Cut to Zero on First $1M

A California court held Apple in contempt on May 1 2025 for ignoring a 2021 order, barring it from taking any commission on off-App-Store purchases, and Epic immediately unveiled June 2025 terms giving developers 0% fees on their first $1 million plus new webshops to route iOS users outside Apple paywalls.

#### Focusing Facts

- Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’ May 1 2025 ruling forbids Apple from collecting any fee on transactions completed via external links and took effect immediately despite Apple’s planned appeal.

- Beginning June 2025 the Epic Games Store will charge 0% revenue share on the first $1,000,000 per app per year, reverting to its 88/12 split after that.

- Developers can now place in-app links directing U.S. and EU iOS players to Epic-hosted webshops that offer 5% user rewards and avoid Apple’s 15–30% cut.

#### Context

Antitrust flashpoints often pivot on a single technical rule—just as the 1998 U.S. v. Microsoft case hinged on bundling Internet Explorer, or AT&T’s 1956 Hush-A-Phone decision cracked open Bell’s network monopoly.  Apple’s steering ban, once dismissed as a ‘minor’ issue among Epic’s ten claims, has now become the wedge that may erode the walled-garden model dominant since the App Store’s 2008 debut.  The episode reflects a broader, decades-long swing: regulators worldwide are re-asserting power over digital ‘gatekeepers’ (EU DMA 2024, India’s CCI probes, U.S. antitrust revival).  If off-store payment norms stick, platform rents—analogous to railway tariffs in the 19th century—could fall across the mobile economy, shifting tens of billions from gatekeepers to creators over the coming century.  Conversely, Apple’s appeal and its capacity to redesign technical hurdles show that legal wins do not automatically translate into market change; the lasting impact will hinge on whether consumers actually follow those extra taps and whether alternative stores achieve the network effects that have eluded challengers since Steam’s 2003 rise.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Gaming enthusiast press (GamesRadar, PC Gamer, Polygon)**: Celebrate Epic’s court win as a major victory for developers and players that finally undercuts Apple’s “exorbitant fees.” Excitement over cheaper games and Fortnite’s return may lead them to overlook that Epic still takes a cut and must convince users to adopt its store.

- **Tech-industry business outlets (VentureBeat, TechCrunch, Engadget)**: Frame the ruling as a watershed antitrust moment that could spark broader competition and new revenue streams for mobile game companies. Their focus on market disruption and investor impact can hype the scale of change while glossing over Apple’s pending appeals and lingering platform control.

- **Skeptical independent tech blogs (Liliputing)**: Warn that despite Epic’s fanfare, Apple still controls iOS distribution and could blunt benefits, so real-world impact remains uncertain. By emphasizing remaining hurdles, they risk understating the immediate fee savings developers can already secure through webshops.
