# Rockstar Pushes Grand Theft Auto VI to 26 May 2026

Rockstar and parent Take-Two quietly shifted GTA VI’s launch from fall 2025 to 26 May 2026, adding roughly eight months to the wait and upending industry release calendars.

#### Focusing Facts

- Take-Two Interactive shares fell about 10 % in pre-market trading on 2 May 2025 after the delay announcement.

- Market analyst Ampere Analysis (cited by GameSpot) still forecasts 40 million GTA VI units sold in its first 12 months, despite the slip.

- All five major Rockstar titles since 2010 (RDR, GTA V, RDR2, GTA Online expansions, now GTA VI) have each been postponed at least once from their original targets.

#### Context

Blockbuster game delays are nothing new: Nintendo’s "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" slipped from 1997 to November 1998, yet went on to redefine 3-D adventure; likewise "GTA V" slid from spring to September 2013 and still sold 190 million copies. The GTA VI push reflects two structural forces: (1) ballooning AAA budgets that now rival Hollywood ($250 m+), making quality-control delays safer than a Cyberpunk-style crash launch; (2) publicly traded publishers juggling quarterly optics against long-tail revenue from live-service ecosystems. On a century horizon, the move is a footnote, but it illuminates how interactive media—barely 50 years old—has matured into a sector whose single title can sway stock prices, shuffle rivals’ road-maps, and even intersect with global trade policy (e.g., tariff-driven console price hikes mentioned in coverage). If the pattern persists, blockbusters may adopt film-like multi-year production and marketing cycles, cementing games as the pre-eminent mass-culture events of the mid-21st century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Gaming enthusiast media (IGN, PCGamesN, GameSpot)**: Present the 2026 delay as disappointing but ultimately a responsible move so Rockstar can deliver the level of polish fans expect. Because these outlets depend on ongoing access to Rockstar and the excitement of their gamer readership, their stories echo the studio’s quality-control talking points and gloss over the commercial hit to the wider industry.

- **Business and financial press (Bloomberg Business, The Verge)**: Frame the postponement primarily through its impact on Take-Two’s share price and future revenue, noting the 8-10 % drop in pre-market trading. A market-centric lens can underplay consumer sentiment or creative motives, as investor-minded outlets are incentivised to spotlight stock volatility and earnings guidance above gameplay concerns.

- **Sensationalist / hype-driven gamer tabloids (Metro, Comicbook)**: Cast the slip to 2026 as the 'worst news possible', stoking fan frustration and spinning speculative theories about earlier dates and secret trailers. Traffic-hungry coverage magnifies outrage and rumor to generate clicks, giving little weight to the practical realities of game development or previous delay patterns.
