# OPEC+ Green-Lights Second 411,000 bpd Supply Boost for June, Pushing Brent Under $60

On 3 May 2025, eight core OPEC+ members voted online to add another 411,000 barrels per day in June—matching May’s surprise hike—and crude prices immediately fell roughly 4 percent to the high-$50s.

#### Focusing Facts

- Brent futures slid as much as 4.1 % to about $58/bbl in early trading on 4 May after the decision.

- Despite the market drop, Saudi Aramco raised its June Arab Light official selling price to Asia by $0.20 per barrel, price list dated 5 May shows.

- The twin May–June increases bring a combined 822,000 bpd of extra supply—nearly six times the 140 k bpd June rise Goldman Sachs had projected.

#### Context

Saudi Arabia’s readiness to open the taps evokes its 1985-86 strategy, when it doubled output from 2.3 mb/d to 5 mb/d and crude crashed 50 %.  Today’s move again weaponises volume to discipline quota violators (Iraq, Kazakhstan) and remind Russia of the 2020 price war—yet it unfolds in a world of slowing demand growth, high U.S.–China trade frictions, and a maturing shale sector that can no longer snap back with 1 mb/d annual gains.  Structurally, the episode underscores the cartel’s century-long dilemma: defending price invites cheating, while defending market share erodes revenue and corrodes internal cohesion.  Whether this 2025 gambit sparks a brief reset (as in 1998, when compliance restored prices within a year) or a long plateau of cheap oil (as in the 1986-1999 doldrums) will shape fiscal stability from Riyadh to Moscow and influence the pace of the energy transition well beyond 2100.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business and financial wire services (Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC)**: Report that the accelerated OPEC+ supply surge is swelling global inventories and driving oil prices to multi-year lows amid weakening demand. Focuses heavily on near-term market mechanics and price moves, largely sidelining the geopolitical stakes or consumer upside, reflecting the outlets’ market-centric orientation.

- **U.S. conservative media outlets (Fox Business, Breitbart)**: Present the output hike as good news for American motorists and a financial blow to Moscow, echoing President Trump’s call for cheaper energy. Narrative foregrounds partisan and geopolitical angles favorable to Trump and hostile to Russia, glossing over possible harm to U.S. producers or broader market volatility.

- **Energy-industry commentary publications (Forbes contributors)**: Warn that lower shale output means OPEC+ still lacks a safety net, so oversupply could persist and prices stay weak despite the cartel’s moves. Relies on forward-looking speculation and highlights shale dynamics to showcase analytical expertise, which may accentuate risk scenarios to captivate an investor readership.
