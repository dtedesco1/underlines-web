# Israel Expands Gaza Offensive with New Corridors Amid Ceasefire Negotiations

Draft ceasefire and hostage release proposals exchanged with Egyptian mediators coincide with Israel’s strategic seizure of corridors in southern Gaza, intensifying displacement and civilian casualties.

#### Focusing Facts

- Egypt’s proposal calls for releasing 8 hostages and bodies for a 40-70 day ceasefire, contrasting US envoy Whitcoff’s earlier deal for 5 hostages and a two-month truce.

- On April 12, Israel’s IDF completed the takeover of the Morag corridor, effectively cutting off Rafah and triggering mass evacuations.

- Since the offensive's resumption on March 18, over 1,500 fatalities and 50,000 casualties have been reported, with a high proportion of children among the dead.

#### Context

This episode echoes historical instances of strategic territorial control and forced population displacement, reminiscent of measures seen during the Suez Crisis in 1956 and urban warfare tactics during the Berlin blockade (1948). Beyond immediate military gains, these developments signal a long-term trend of using engineered corridors and strict evacuation orders to reshape battle lines—a tactic that has evolved in the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On a century-long timescale, such actions underscore a broader shift towards combining military strategy with humanitarian coercion, raising enduring questions about civilian protection and the legality of enforced displacement in conflict zones.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli government-aligned media**: This group portrays the military operations as necessary defensive measures designed to dismantle terrorist infrastructure, secure hostages, and establish security zones in Gaza. They emphasize the legitimacy and necessity of force while downplaying the humanitarian costs, potentially reflecting governmental or strategic security interests. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg5jwyje0do), [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-849937))

- **Pro-Palestinian humanitarian outlets**: This group emphasizes the heavy toll on Palestinian civilians, highlighting widespread casualties, forced displacement, and the dire humanitarian crisis brought by the military offensive. They tend to focus on civilian suffering and structural injustices while critiquing Israeli policies, which can amplify narratives of victimhood and downplay security concerns.
