# Trump Admin Passback Proposes 50% Cut to NASA Science

In April 2025, the Trump administration's draft 2026 budget sharply reduces NASA's science funding from roughly $7.5 billion to $3.9 billion, threatening key missions and centers.

#### Focusing Facts

- Astrophysics funding slashed from $1.5B to $487M; planetary science cut from $2.7B to $1.9B.

- The proposal cancels the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope and hints at closing Goddard Space Flight Center with 10,000 jobs at risk.

- Overall NASA budget faces a 20% cut ($5B reduction from $25B), starting with a document delivered on April 10, 2025.

#### Context

This budget move mirrors past episodes of significant science funding retrenchment, reminiscent of the 1970s adjustments after the Apollo era when shifting political dynamics led to drastic cuts. Over decades, U.S. space policy has oscillated between ambitious expansion and tight budget controls, reflecting deeper systemic debates about government investment in long-term scientific innovation. While this draft proposal may be revised in Congress, its aggressive cuts underscore a recurring pattern: short-term political priorities can jeopardize decades-long scientific progress, with potential impacts that reverberate for a century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Science and Policy Advocates**: They condemn the proposed NASA budget cuts as an extinction-level event that would decimate critical science programs, cripple American space leadership, and waste decades of investments in exploration. Their focus on national prestige and long-term scientific progress might lead them to overemphasize the immediate catastrophic impacts, reflecting a commitment to more generous federal science funding.

- **Tech Industry Insiders**: They express deep concern over the cutsâ€”cautioning that while they support robust science, figures like Elon Musk highlight the problematic nature of the budget proposal while noting conflicts of interest in discussing NASA funding. Their commentary is shaped by industry ties and potential conflicts, leading to a more measured critique that may downplay systemic political overreach in favor of protecting their own business interests.
