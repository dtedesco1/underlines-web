# Trump Exempts Key Electronics from Tariffs Amid Escalating US-China Trade War

On April 12, 2025, the Trump administration revised its tariff policy to exclude smartphones, computers, semiconductor components, and associated manufacturing equipment, alleviating potential price hikes during an intensifying trade dispute with China.

#### Focusing Facts

- The exemptions remove these products from a 125% tariff on Chinese imports and a 10% global tariff applied to nearly all other countries.

- Effective April 5, updated U.S. Customs and Border Protection guidance prevents cumulative tariff stacking on these critical electronic components.

- TSMC and other chipmakers have announced major US investments following the tariff relief.

#### Context

This maneuver echoes past trade adjustments like the tariff modifications pre-dating the WTO era, yet it differs by targeting a high-tech sector vital to global supply chains. In 1930, sweeping tariffs such as the Smoot-Hawley Act disrupted international commerce; now, selective exemptions are employed to mitigate domestic consumer impact while maintaining pressure on China. In the longer term, this event signifies an evolving pattern where economic tactics are finely tuned to avoid broad market disruptions amid geopolitical rivalry, reflecting the persistent tug-of-war between globalization and protectionism over the next century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business and Tech Media**: These outlets emphasize that the tariff exemptions will shield consumers from sharp price hikes and facilitate major tech companies’ investments in the US, noting benefits for giants like Apple and TSMC. They tend to focus on market stability and corporate benefits, potentially downplaying the broader strategic and domestic manufacturing impacts of the tariffs.

- **Mainstream Political and Critical Media**: These sources highlight that the exemptions are a politically calculated pivot that undermines a tougher trade stance and could signal a temporary or inconsistent policy, potentially favoring corporate interests over a robust economic strategy. They may overemphasize the political missteps and long-term strategic weaknesses of the administration’s approach, reflecting skepticism about Trump’s trade war rhetoric.
