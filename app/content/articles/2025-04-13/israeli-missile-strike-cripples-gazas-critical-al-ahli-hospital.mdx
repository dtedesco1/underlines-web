# Israeli Missile Strike Cripples Gaza’s Critical Al-Ahli Hospital

On April 13, 2025, two Israeli missiles hit the Al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, destroying key emergency and reception facilities and forcing a rapid evacuation of patients following an advanced warning.

#### Focusing Facts

- Two Israeli missiles struck the hospital's emergency and reception building on April 13, 2025.

- The Israeli military claimed the target housed a Hamas command center, while health officials reported extensive damage and an urgent patient evacuation.

- This incident follows a deadly October 2023 attack at the same hospital that resulted in hundreds of casualties amid contested accounts.

#### Context

This event is part of a recurrent pattern of conflict-related strikes on civilian infrastructure in Gaza, echoing historical episodes like the Balkan hospital bombings of the early 1990s where humanitarian sites became unintended—or controversially intended—targets. Over the long term, the repeated targeting of medical facilities reflects deep-rooted challenges in modern warfare: balancing legitimate security concerns against the imperative of protecting non-combatant sanctuaries. This strike, amid ongoing ceasefire talks and following prior deadly incidents in 2023, raises enduring questions about the militarization of civilian spaces and the slow evolution of international norms to safeguard essential humanitarian institutions over a century of warfare evolution.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli government and allied media**: They assert that the hospital was attacked because it was being used as a command center by Hamas and thus served as a legitimate military target amid an ongoing conflict. This narrative may understate civilian suffering and exaggerate the military use of civilian infrastructure to justify the strike.

- **Hamas-aligned and Palestinian sources**: They condemn the strike as a deliberate attack on a vital healthcare facility, portraying it as a war crime that further cripples Gaza’s already devastated health system. This account can overemphasize Israeli aggression and humanitarian impact without fully acknowledging claims of Hamas using civilian spaces for military purposes.
