# Governments Unveil Wave of Mid-2025 Revenue Pivots Amid Debt Squeeze

Between 20–22 June 2025, lawmakers in five countries rolled out or advanced unconventional tax measures— from the U.S. Senate’s re-scored $3 trn cut, to UK, Australian, Pakistani and Illinois plans for new levies—signalling a coordinated fiscal pivot to plug widening post-pandemic deficits without overtly raising headline income-tax rates.

#### Focusing Facts

- Under the GOP’s new “current-policy” baseline released 22 Jun 2025, extending Trump-era individual rate cuts is scored at $83 bn instead of the $2.2 trn estimate issued in May.

- HMRC data published 22 Jun 2025 showed April-May tax receipts up £8.6 bn year-on-year to £142.8 bn after Chancellor Reeves’ hikes to NI and frozen thresholds.

- Illinois SB1938 would launch a one-year Vehicle-Miles-Traveled tax pilot, with a full impact report due to the General Assembly within 18 months.

#### Context

Moments like this echo 1968–69, when the U.S. surtax, Canada’s capital-gains tax and Europe’s early VATs appeared within a 12-month window as governments scrambled to fund Vietnam-era and welfare commitments.  The common thread in 2025 is the collision of aging populations, green-transition costs and post-COVID debt— a structural squeeze reminiscent of the inter-war fiscal crises of 1920-32 that birthed modern income-tax systems.  Today’s tinkering—creative baselines, endowment surcharges, mileage fees—signals a shift from broad-based rate moves toward granular, behavior-targeted levies and accounting maneuvers.  Over a 100-year horizon, whether this patchwork forestalls or merely postpones a wholesale rewrite of tax architecture (comparable to the 1913 U.S. 16th Amendment or Europe’s 1967 VAT Directive) will determine if these June 2025 experiments are footnotes or turning points in the long evolution of state finance.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning media (e.g., Express, The Telegraph, Sky News Australia)**: Present recent or mooted tax rises—from Rachel Reeves’s £8 bn “tax raid” to a flat levy on family trusts—as burdens that will hit households and business investment and could backfire on the wider economy. Stories stress the pain to taxpayers and the risk to growth while glossing over why governments say extra revenue is needed, reflecting a small-government, low-tax ideological stance evident in their framing.

- **Center-left and progressive outlets (e.g., Washington Post opinions, Dawn, Australian Broadcasting Corporation)**: Argue that large deficits, inequality and intergenerational unfairness require broader tax reform that raises more from the wealthy, closes loopholes and widens the base even if some groups lose out. Coverage highlights fairness and fiscal necessity but pays scant attention to potential behavioural responses or growth effects, mirroring a redistributive policy preference found in the pieces. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/22/big-beautiful-bill-revenue-tax-budget/), [Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1918634))

- **Business-focused financial publications (e.g., Forbes, Yahoo Finance, Chronicle of Higher Education)**: Analyse specialised tax ideas—mileage levies, tariff-funded income-tax cuts, new endowment brackets—mainly through fiscal math and market incentives, treating taxation as a design problem to match costs with usage or revenue needs. Their technocratic lens can underplay distributional justice and accept assumptions favourable to investors or industry, echoing a pro-efficiency, business-centric worldview evident in their reporting.
