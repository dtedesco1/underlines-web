# U.S. Air Force Flattens Fordow, Natanz & Esfahan in First-Ever Direct Strike on Iran

On 22 June 2025 President Trump ordered B-2 bombers carrying 30,000-lb bunker-busters to hit Iran’s three main enrichment complexes, abruptly ending stalled talks and pulling the United States overtly into the Israel-Iran war.

#### Focusing Facts

- At 19:04 EDT, 22 Jun 2025, Trump posted on Truth Social that a “full payload of BOMBS” had been dropped on Fordow, Natanz and Esfahan and that “all planes are now outside of Iran air space.”

- No congressional war declaration preceded the strikes; Rep. Thomas Massie said he will introduce a War Powers Resolution on 24 Jun 2025 to bar further U.S. combat in Iran.

- Israeli officials confirmed Iran launched retaliatory missile fire on Tel Aviv roughly six hours after the U.S. raid, injuring 27 people (IDF preliminary tally).

#### Context

Washington’s decision echoes Israel’s 1981 Operation Opera against Iraq’s Osirak reactor and the 2007 Israeli raid on Syria’s Al-Kibar site—single-night strikes meant to reset a nuclear clock—yet, unlike those clandestine precedents, this is the first time the U.S. has openly bombed sovereign Iranian territory, a country it helped overthrow a government in 1953 but has avoided attacking directly for 72 years.  The strike underscores two longer arcs: the post-Cold-War normalization of preventive force against nuclear aspirants, and a widening erosion of congressional authority over war powers that began with Kosovo in 1999 and Iraq in 2003.  By wagering that military shock will delay Tehran’s program without spiralling into regional conflagration, Washington may instead reinforce the century-long trend—observed after North Korea’s 2003 NPT exit—that states outside America’s security umbrella see nuclear weapons as the ultimate insurance.  Whether the 2025 raid proves a fleeting tactical success or the moment Iran, like India in 1998, decides the bomb is indispensable could shape Middle-East power balances—and the global non-proliferation regime—for the next hundred years.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning U.S. outlets (Fox News, Axios, The Hill)**: They frame the strikes as a “very successful” mission that decisively degraded Iran’s nuclear program and showcased American military prowess. Affinity for Trump’s agenda leads them to echo his celebratory language and gloss over constitutional questions or the risk of wider conflict, as seen in their straightforward reproduction of his Truth Social posts.

- **Left-leaning commentary and analysis (The Guardian, The Atlantic)**: They argue Trump has blundered into a reckless war that could inflame the Middle East and actually increase the chance Iran pursues a bomb. Long-standing scepticism toward U.S. military interventions and deep antipathy to Trump colour the coverage, stressing worst-case scenarios and drawing historical analogies to Iraq even before outcomes are known.

- **International public broadcasters & mainstream U.S. networks (BBC, NBC News, CNBC)**: Their reports highlight the strike as a major escalation, note Israel-U.S. coordination and warn of possible Iranian retaliation while stressing that damage claims cannot yet be confirmed. Dependence on official briefings for fast-moving facts can let government talking points set the frame and underplay deeper context or constitutional debates.
