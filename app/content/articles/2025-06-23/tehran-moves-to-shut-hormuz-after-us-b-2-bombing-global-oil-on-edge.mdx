# Tehran Moves to Shut Hormuz After U.S. B-2 Bombing; Global Oil on Edge

On 22 Jun 2025 Iran’s parliament formally voted to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for U.S. air-strikes on its nuclear sites, handing the final go-or-no-go decision to the Supreme National Security Council later the same day.

#### Focusing Facts

- The parliamentary motion passed Sunday would block a corridor that carried roughly 20 million bpd—about 20% of world oil—in 2024, pending council approval expected “by tonight,” according to state-run Press TV.

- Crypto prediction market Polymarket repriced the odds of a Hormuz shutdown before July from 15% to 60% within hours of the B-2 strikes on Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.

- Brent crude futures spiked 4% to $78.89 per barrel at Sunday’s Asia open, the highest level in five months, while two super-tankers were observed making U-turns mid-strait.

#### Context

Great-power energy choke points have often become flashpoints only after outside intervention—from Britain’s 1956 seizure of the Suez Canal to the 1984-88 “Tanker War,” when 451 ships were hit and the U.S. ultimately re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers.  Iran’s latest threat fits that playbook: wield the strait as leverage without necessarily closing it, balancing deterrence against self-harm (80 % of Iran’s crude goes to China).  Long-term, the episode underscores two structural shifts: first, sea-lane security is migrating from a U.S. monopoly toward contested, multipolar enforcement as Beijing’s energy dependence grows; second, oil’s pricing power is weakening in an era of excess supply and sluggish demand, so even a prospective 20 % supply shock only lifted Brent to the high-70s, not 2022’s triple digits.  Whether the strait actually shuts or not, the signal is clear: chokepoint diplomacy remains a 21st-century tool, but its economic bite—and Washington’s automatic dominance—are no longer guaranteed, shaping energy trade and naval strategy for decades.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-wing populist U.S. outlets (e.g., InfoWars, New York Post)**: Frame Iran’s parliament vote as virtual confirmation that Tehran will imminently shut the Strait of Hormuz, warning that oil and gas prices are set to "surge sharply" and that Trump’s strikes were a "spectacular success." Sensationalist tone amplifies worst-case scenarios and praises U.S. military action, which drives traffic and aligns with a hawkish, pro-Trump audience even though past threats have not translated into actual closures.

- **Mainstream U.S. business media (e.g., CNBC, Yahoo Finance, NBC, Bloomberg Business)**: Stress the major economic stakes and quote U.S. officials urging China to restrain Iran, noting that a prolonged blockage could push crude above $100–$120 and roil markets worldwide. Market-centric framing may overstate price shocks to hold readers’ attention and bolster demand for financial analysis, while largely accepting U.S. officials’ assurances that closing the waterway would be "economic suicide" for Iran.

- **European and international general-news outlets (e.g., BBC, ProtoThema English)**: Argue that despite the missile exchanges, ample global supply and sluggish demand make a sustained price spike unlikely and note experts who say Iran has "little to gain and too much to lose" from actually sealing the strait. By highlighting supply data and past precedent, they may underplay the geopolitical escalation risk—reassuring audiences and governments that rely on Gulf energy flows while leaning on Western energy analysts’ forecasts.
