# Pioneering Gene-Edited Pig Liver Transplant in China Achieves 10-Day Function

Chinese scientists successfully transplanted a genetically modified pig liver into a brain-dead patient at Xi'an’s Xijing Hospital, demonstrating functional bile and protein production for 10 days as a proof-of-concept for bridging therapy.

#### Focusing Facts

- The liver came from a genetically modified Bama miniature pig with six gene edits to reduce immune rejection.

- Performed on a 50-year-old brain-dead patient, the native liver was left intact, with the pig liver monitored for 10 days before termination at the family's request.

- Details were published in Nature, marking the first in vivo pig liver transplant in a human body.

#### Context

This breakthrough represents a significant milestone in the longstanding pursuit of xenotransplantation—a field that has aimed to overcome organ shortages through inter-species transplants. Similar to earlier experiments in the 1990s and recent trials with pig hearts and kidneys, this event underscores the potential of gene editing in mitigating immune rejection. However, like past trials, it raises complex questions about long-term viability, safety, and ethical considerations, as the experiment was limited to 10 days and involved a brain-dead patient. Historically, each incremental advance—from early organ perfusion techniques post-World War II to modern genetic modifications—has been met with cautious optimism. This trial adds valuable data to the evolving narrative of organ replacement therapy, suggesting that while temporary xenografts may soon provide bridges for patients awaiting human transplants, broader adoption will require addressing enduring challenges such as immune compatibility and inter-species disease transmission. Over a century, such innovations could fundamentally transform transplant medicine and alleviate chronic organ shortages.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Science-focused media outlets**: They emphasize the breakthrough potential of the pig liver xenotransplant as an experimental step towards addressing organ shortages, while acknowledging limitations like the short functioning period and need for further research. This group might lean towards optimism about scientific progress, potentially downplaying the ethical and long-term medical uncertainties of xenotransplantation.

- **Sensationalist tabloid outlets**: They present the event as a dramatic, world-first achievement, highlighting the novelty and success of the procedure with attention-grabbing headlines. This group tends to oversimplify or hype the breakthrough without sufficiently addressing the experimental nature and the temporary success of the transplant.
