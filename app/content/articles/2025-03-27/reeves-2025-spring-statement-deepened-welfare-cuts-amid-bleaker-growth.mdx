# Reeves’ 2025 Spring Statement: Deepened Welfare Cuts Amid Bleaker Growth

Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled a revamped Spring Statement on March 26, 2025, intensifying welfare cuts to address a £1.6bn shortfall after the OBR slashed GDP growth forecasts from 2% to 1%, while boosting defence spending by £2.2bn.

#### Focusing Facts

- The Office for Budget Responsibility revised the 2025 GDP growth forecast from 2% to 1%, forcing an extra £1.6bn in welfare savings.

- The statement confirmed a £2.2bn increase in defence spending and a target of reducing public sector administrative costs by 15% by 2030.

- Impact assessments indicate that over 3 million families could be £1,720 worse off annually, with 250,000 more people pushed into relative poverty.

#### Context

The aggressive welfare cuts mirror historical austerity responses seen in previous UK fiscal crises, such as the post-2010 measures and the controversial mini-budget under Liz Truss, when swift, painful reforms were used to restore fiscal credibility. Reeves’ policies reflect a longstanding systemic dilemma: balancing fiscal consolidation against social welfare, a tension that has shaped British economic policy since the post-war era. On a century-long scale, these reforms are part of recurring cycles of fiscal tightening that aim to rebuild public finances amid challenging global conditions, but they also risk undermining social safety nets and long-term growth prospects.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: They criticize Reeves for imposing deep welfare cuts that disproportionately harm the most vulnerable and worsen inequality, arguing that these measures sacrifice social support in the name of fiscal discipline. This narrative may be driven by a desire to defend social justice and protect low-income groups, potentially underplaying the fiscal challenges and the need for long-term sustainability.

- **Right leaning media**: They portray Reeves’ policies as a disastrous mix of punitive tax increases and damaging welfare cuts, arguing that her economic management has led to a weak growth forecast and an unforgivable tax raid on working people. This perspective often emphasizes fiscal mismanagement and blame, potentially overstating the economic fallout while neglecting the complexities of balancing public finances.
