# BYD Surpasses Tesla with $107B Revenue, Redefining the EV Race

In 2024, BYD not only outstripped Tesla’s revenue with 777 billion yuan ($107B) but also showcased technological breakthroughs and expansion strategies that are reshaping the global EV market.

#### Focusing Facts

- BYD reported 777 billion yuan in revenue for 2024, a 29% increase, outpacing Tesla's $97.7 billion.

- Deliveries reached 4.27 million vehicles in 2024 and BYD unveiled a 1,000 kW charging system that adds 250 miles of range in 5 minutes.

- Tesla experienced its first annual sales decline in a decade amid controversies and geopolitical tariff challenges.

#### Context

This development echoes past industrial shifts, such as Japan’s ascension in the auto market during the 1980s when Japanese models eclipsed American counterparts through innovation and efficiency. BYD’s rise, bolstered by China’s Make in China 2025 initiative launched in 2015, reflects a long-term trend of state-supported technological prowess disrupting established global players. While this moment signals a significant recalibration in competitive dynamics within the EV sector, it also serves as a reminder that industrial evolution, driven by rapid innovation and strategic government backing, alters global power structures for generations to come.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream Business News**: This group reports on BYD overtaking Tesla by emphasizing robust sales figures, technological advances in charging and overall market performance while noting Tesla's controversies and declining global sales. Focusing heavily on market metrics and competitive comparisons, these outlets may overlook broader socio-political contexts or downplay the role of state support behind BYD’s success. ([Yahoo!

- **Left-Leaning Opinion Media**: This perspective posits that BYD’s breakthrough is not just microeconomic success but a demonstration of effective state-supported industrial strategy in contrast to Elon Musk’s controversial, market-driven practices. Such editorials may overemphasize political and strategic aspects in favor of critiquing Western free-market policies and tend to frame Musk’s leadership negatively to advocate for state-guided models.
