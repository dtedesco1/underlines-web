# Sudanese Army Reclaims Key Khartoum Assets in Decisive March 2025 Push

On March 26, 2025, Sudanese forces recaptured Khartoum’s airport and presidential palace, marking a significant tactical reversal in the two-year conflict with the RSF.

#### Focusing Facts

- Khartoum airport and presidential palace were retaken on March 26, 2025 amid rapid military advances.

- General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan declared ‘Khartoum is free’ as troops encircled key bridges and pushed RSF fighters southward.

- Despite gains, RSF still holds footholds in western Darfur and parts of southern Khartoum.

#### Context

The recapture echoes historical sieges like Vicksburg in 1863, where controlling a transport hub reshaped regional power. This development is a symptom of longstanding internal divisions and external meddling that have plagued Sudan since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Over a centennial view, while isolated battles rarely redraw maps permanently, these shifts signal deep changes in authority and control that may influence the nation’s trajectory and its susceptibility to partition and external intervention in decades to come.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **UK/European mainstream media**: These outlets highlight the recapture of Khartoum’s key installations as a symbolic and decisive military victory that restores national order and pride, echoing official statements from military leaders. They tend to rely heavily on official military sources and celebratory narratives, possibly downplaying ongoing humanitarian issues and RSF atrocities.

- **US analytical media**: This group presents the military gains within a broader, more complex context, emphasizing the humanitarian crisis, implications for war crimes, and the risks of a fragmented future for Sudan. They may overemphasize the negative long-term impacts and human costs, influenced by a focus on accountability and geopolitical analysis.

- **Right-leaning US media**: These sources concentrate on the strategic and tactical aspects of the army’s advance, portraying the recapture as a necessary and hard-fought victory in the larger battle for national unity. They may understate the humanitarian fallout and broader consequences of the conflict by focusing on military success and strategic narratives.
