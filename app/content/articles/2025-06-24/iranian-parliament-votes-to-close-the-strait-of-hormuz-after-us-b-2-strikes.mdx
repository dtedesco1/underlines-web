# Iranian Parliament Votes to Close the Strait of Hormuz After U.S. B-2 Strikes

On 22 June 2025 Iran’s Majles formally backed shutting the Strait of Hormuz—moving the final call to the Supreme National Security Council—hours after U.S. bombers hit three Iranian nuclear sites.

#### Focusing Facts

- Polymarket odds of a Hormuz shutdown by July jumped from 15% to 60% after the vote and U.S. strikes.

- U.S. B-2s struck Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities on 21 June 2025, the first overt U.S. attack on Iran since 2020.

- Brent crude briefly spiked 10% to $80.0 per barrel, its highest since January, before settling near $78.9.

#### Context

Chokepoint brinkmanship in the Gulf is hardly new: during the 1984-88 “Tanker War,” 451 ships were hit and the U.S. re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers to keep them moving. Today’s vote revives that playbook but in a world where Asia—not the West—takes 84 % of Hormuz crude and China is Iran’s economic lifeline. The episode illuminates two longer arcs: the enduring leverage of narrow maritime arteries even as the world talks energy transition, and the erosion of U.S. deterrence dominance as regional actors test red lines under a tripolar (U.S.–China–Middle East) balance. Whether the council actually orders a closure matters less than the signal: small procedural moves can now swing global inflation expectations and great-power diplomacy. A century from now historians may view this as another marker of hydrocarbon geopolitics’ late stage—when fossil fuel chokepoints still shaped markets even as renewables rose—much like the 1904 Russo-Japanese contest over Port Arthur foreshadowed shifts in naval power yet could not halt coal’s decline.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-wing populist / conservative tabloid media (InfoWars, New York Post)**: Portrays Iran as on the brink of definitively shutting the Strait of Hormuz, warning that oil will "surge sharply" and that the West must brace for severe turmoil. Uses sensational framing and selective military quotes that exaggerate the likelihood of closure, which can stoke fear, drive clicks and buttress hawkish U.S. policy toward Iran.

- **Mainstream public broadcasters (BBC, ITV)**: Explain the strait’s strategic importance while stressing expert opinion that Iran has “little to gain and too much to lose,” so any blockade would probably be temporary and dealt with quickly by the U.S. Navy. Reliance on government officials and academic experts may subtly echo Western diplomatic messaging and under-state worst-case energy-price scenarios so as not to panic audiences.

- **Business-focused financial media (ProtoThema, Yahoo Finance)**: Argue that ample global crude supply and weak demand will cap prices near $80-$90 even if tensions rise, and that markets doubt Iran will actually close the waterway. Analytical pieces aimed at investors may minimize geopolitical tail-risk to preserve market confidence and align with banks’ price forecasts cited in the stories.
