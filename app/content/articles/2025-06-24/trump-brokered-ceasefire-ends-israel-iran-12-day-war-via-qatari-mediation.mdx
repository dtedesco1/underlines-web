# Trump-Brokered Ceasefire Ends Israel-Iran “12-Day War” via Qatari Mediation

On 23 June 2025, Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran accepted a U.S.–Qatar-brokered plan to halt hostilities in staggered 6-, 12-, and 24-hour phases, formally closing the 12-day air-and-missile war.

#### Focusing Facts

- Ceasefire clock: Iran stops fire ~6 hours after Trump’s 23 Jun post, Israel 12 hours later, with war declared over at the 24-hour mark on 24 Jun 2025.

- Qatar’s PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani secured Tehran’s consent in a late-night call after Iran’s 14-missile strike on the U.S. Al-Udeid base caused zero casualties.

- U.S. entry on 21 Jun destroyed Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites with bunker-buster strikes, prompting Iran’s limited retaliation and subsequent negotiations.

#### Context

Flashpoints where outside powers freeze regional wars are not new: the October 24 1973 U.S.–Soviet-pushed ceasefire that ended the Yom Kippur War likewise followed super-power brinkmanship and last-minute missile exchanges. Today’s deal fits a longer arc in which the U.S. oscillates between kinetic strikes and ad-hoc diplomacy to manage Middle-East nuclear fears (see 1981 Osirak raid, 2015 JCPOA, 2020 “maximum pressure”). What is novel is Washington leveraging a Gulf micro-state—Qatar—rather than great-power co-signers, signaling a shift toward networked, multipolar crisis brokerage. If durable, this moment could cap a 40-year shadow conflict between Israel and Iran and reset nuclear negotiations; if it unravels, it may instead underscore how social-media diplomacy and unilateral strikes amplify hair-trigger escalation. On a century scale, the episode tests whether high-precision, prompt strikes paired with back-channel mediation can replace protracted interstate wars, or whether they merely compress cycles of violence into ever-shorter, more volatile bursts.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning US conservative media (Fox News, Breitbart, Daily Wire)**: Portrays Trump’s announced ceasefire as an unprecedented diplomatic triumph that ended the "12-Day War" and averted a regional disaster through his strong leadership. Heavily credits Trump while glossing over lingering uncertainties about Israeli or Iranian confirmation, aligning the narrative with pro-Trump political interests and audience expectations. ([Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-announces-historic-iran-israel-ceasefire-agreement-end-12-day-war), [Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/faith/2025/06/21/trump-thanks-god-after-iran-strike-we-love-you-god-protect-our-military/))

- **International mainstream outlets and wire services (BBC, AP, Reuters, The Guardian)**: Treat the ceasefire announcement cautiously, noting that neither side has fully confirmed it and highlighting ongoing missile fire and diplomatic ambiguity. Skepticism toward Trump’s claims may downplay possible diplomatic progress, reflecting an institutional tendency to emphasise verification and critique his unpredictability. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr3yxgjd6ro?xtor=AL-72-%255Bpartner%255D-%255Binforadio%255D-%255Bheadline%255D-%255Bnews%255D-%255Bbizdev%255D-%255Bisapi%255D), [AP NEWS](https://apnews.com/live/iran-israel-war-updates-6-24-2025))

- **Israeli national media (The Times of Israel)**: Frames the possible ceasefire around Israel’s military objectives, stressing that Jerusalem will end operations only after degrading Iran’s capabilities and securing nuclear concessions. Centres the narrative on Israeli strategic priorities and depicts Iran as the main hold-out, potentially minimising civilian costs and international diplomatic factors.
