# After Seven Delays, Axiom-4 Locked for 25 June 2025 Launch to ISS

NASA, Axiom Space and SpaceX have reset the private Ax-4 mission—carrying India’s Shubhanshu Shukla and led by Peggy Whitson—for a 02:31 EDT liftoff on 25 June after weeks of technical and ISS-readiness setbacks.

#### Focusing Facts

- Confirmed launch window: 2:31 a.m. EDT (06:31 GMT; 12:01 IST) 25 Jun 2025 from Launch Complex 39A, Kennedy Space Center.

- Mission slipped seven times between 29 May and 22 Jun due to Falcon 9 liquid-oxygen leak, weather, and inspection of a potential pressure leak in the ISS Zvezda module.

- If successful, Shukla will be the first Indian on the ISS and the first Indian in space since Rakesh Sharma in 1984.

#### Context

Commercial crew launches missing their first date is hardly new—Gemini 6A in 1965 famously scrubbed hours before liftoff, and SpaceX’s own Demo-2 shifted three days in May 2020—yet the Ax-4 string of seven postponements underlines two structural realities. First, the 26-year-old ISS is entering an end-of-life phase where every leak in Russia’s Zvezda (added in 2000) ripples through international schedules, echoing Mir’s ageing-station headaches of the late 1990s. Second, low-Earth-orbit access is migrating from super-power monopoly to a service economy: Axiom buys seats, smaller nations such as India, Hungary and Poland piggy-back, and legacy astronauts like Peggy Whitson return as commercial commanders. On a century scale, today’s hiccup matters less than the precedent it sets—demonstrating that multi-country, fee-for-service flights can still be bottlenecked by frail shared infrastructure. Whether humanity builds robust commercial stations in the 2030s or repeats the ISS’s maintenance quagmire will determine if 2125 historians view Ax-4 as pioneering or merely another crowded chapter in the twilight of the ISS era.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian pro-space achievement outlets (Economic Times, IndiaTimes, DNA, Asianet, India.com, Pragativadi)**: Portray the June 25 launch as a major triumph that will return India to human spaceflight and showcase international cooperation, emphasising that the mission is finally ‘good news for India’. Driven by national pride and dependence on official press releases, these outlets highlight success and minimise technical risks or the possibility of further delays. ([Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/indias-shubhanshu-shuklas-axiom-4-mission-now-targeting-june-25-launch/articleshow/122036821.cms), [IndiaTimes](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/after-six-delays-axiom-4-mission-carrying-indias-shubhanshu-shukla-cleared-for-launch-check-date-time-and-other-details-661837.html))

- **Indian accountability-focused newspapers (The Indian Express, The Week)**: Stress that Axiom-4 has already been postponed six-plus times because of hardware faults, weather and ISS problems, casting doubt on NASA’s readiness. By cataloguing every setback they amplify a sense of dysfunction to engage readers, potentially downplaying the broader scientific significance once the launch proceeds. ([The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/why-axiom-4-mission-delayed-timeline-new-date-10083360/), [The Week](https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2025/06/20/nasa-defers-axiom-4-mission-s-launch-for-sixth-time-no-new-date-yet.html))

- **International mainstream Western media (BBC)**: Frame the story around astronaut Shukla’s personal journey—what he will take aboard and the historic nature of his trip—rather than technical or scheduling issues. The human-interest angle caters to a global audience but glosses over the mission’s repeated delays and geopolitical symbolism, giving a softer, less critical picture.
