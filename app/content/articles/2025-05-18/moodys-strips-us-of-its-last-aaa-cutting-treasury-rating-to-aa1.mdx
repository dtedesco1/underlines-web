# Moody’s Strips U.S. of Its Last AAA, Cutting Treasury Rating to Aa1

On 16 May 2025 Moody’s downgraded U.S. sovereign debt one notch to Aa1, ending America’s clean sweep of triple-A ratings for the first time in over a century.

#### Focusing Facts

- Rating lowered from Aaa to Aa1 on 16 May 2025, citing debt above $36 trillion and rising interest costs.

- With Fitch’s August 2023 and S&P’s August 2011 cuts, no major agency now carries a U.S. AAA rating.

- 10-year Treasury yield spiked to 4.48 % in after-hours trading immediately after the announcement.

#### Context

Credit downgrades rarely move markets for reserve-currency issuers, but they are political milestones.  The last time a premier sovereign lost unanimous top ratings—Britain in 2013 after debt hit 90 % of GDP—borrowing costs barely budged, yet the loss symbolized waning fiscal discipline.  America’s new Aa1 echoes S&P’s 2011 cut during the debt-ceiling standoff and even conjures the 1979 Treasury payment glitch when Congress’s delay briefly dented faith in “risk-free” bills.  Structurally, the decision reflects a four-decade trend: post-1980 tax cuts and entitlement expansions drove federal debt from 31 % of GDP in 1981 to roughly 120 % today, while polarized politics makes long-horizon budgeting nearly impossible.  Rating firms—whose own reputations were battered in 2008—may be amplifying rather than dictating reality, yet their action codifies a shift already under way: the U.S. is transitioning from unquestioned creditor to highly leveraged hegemon.  On a 100-year arc, the downgrade by itself will not dethrone the dollar, but it marks another notch in the slow erosion of the fiscal cushion that underpinned Pax Americana since 1945; future historians may view it as an early warning, akin to the 1968 gold-window strain that preceded the 1971 dollar-gold break.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Financial wire and business outlets (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg Business)**: They report the downgrade chiefly as a consequence of the United States’ swelling debt load and rising interest costs, stressing how markets reacted to the loss of the final AAA. By centering on debt metrics, ratings-agency statements and investor moves, they implicitly validate the agencies’ authority and skirt partisan accountability, reflecting an investor-oriented newsroom incentive structure.

- **Left-leaning U.S. national media (e.g., The New York Times, Washington Post)**: They frame the Moody’s action as a direct rebuke to Republican and Trump-era tax cut plans, presenting the downgrade as evidence that conservative fiscal policy worsens the deficit. This partisan framing aligns with progressive editorial positions and may downplay Democratic contributions to the debt, turning a structural problem into a mainly Republican narrative. ([The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/us-credit-downgrade-moodys.html), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/05/16/credit-rating-triple-abudget/))

- **International broadcasters and general news magazines (e.g., BBC, Newsweek)**: They depict the downgrade as a historic moment ending more than a century of perfect U.S. credit, blaming long-running debt growth and bipartisan political dysfunction. The dramatic, milestone-focused language draws audience attention but can oversimplify current policy details and overstate near-term economic fallout for narrative impact.
