# Putin and Trump Pull Out of Istanbul Peace Summit, Talks Downscaled

Hours before the first Russia-Ukraine peace talks since 2022 were to open on 15 May 2025, both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump confirmed they would not attend, leaving second-tier delegations to meet in Istanbul and slashing hopes of a breakthrough.

#### Focusing Facts

- Kremlin statement late 14 May 2025 named presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky and Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin to head Russia’s team, explicitly omitting Putin.

- A senior U.S. official told media on 14 May 2025 that Trump would remain in Qatar, sending Secretary of State Marco Rubio and envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg instead.

- If they occur, the Istanbul talks would be the first direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations since the 29 March 2022 Dolmabahçe session.

#### Context

Summit diplomacy often hinges on leader presence: the 1995 Dayton Accords only crystallised once Presidents Clinton, Milosevic and Izetbegović were locked on an Ohio base for 21 days. By contrast, today’s Istanbul gathering echoes the 1951 Panmunjom preliminaries, where absent heads of state produced only a protracted armistice process. The no-shows by Putin and Trump underline two structural shifts: (1) great-power leaders increasingly use delegation diplomacy to avoid personal political risk, and (2) middle powers like Turkey exploit vacuums to burnish international stature, just as Finland did hosting the 1975 Helsinki Final Act. Over a hundred-year horizon, this moment may register less as a step toward peace than as further evidence of stalled conflict resolution when nuclear-armed states face no external compulsion—reinforcing a post-Cold-War pattern where wars (Afghanistan 2001-21, Syria 2011-) linger when top decision-makers stay off the table.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (The Guardian, BBC, The New York Times, The Independent)**: They frame Putin’s and, to a lesser degree, Trump’s absence as proof Moscow is not serious about peace while portraying Zelenskyy as willing but obstructed by the Kremlin, so prospects for a breakthrough are slim. Coverage foregrounds Russian intransigence and subtly validates Western support for Kyiv, downplaying any Ukrainian or U.S. responsibility for stalled diplomacy and highlighting domestic politics (e.g., Erdogan’s benefit) rather than Western mis-steps.

- **Business-focused U.S. and international outlets (CNBC, The Straits Times, NBC News)**: They stress the diplomatic drama of both Putin and Trump skipping the talks, describing muddled logistics and suggesting all sides—Kyiv, Moscow and Washington—bear responsibility for the confusion and lack of progress. By centering on the spectacle and equivalently critiquing every actor, the reporting can create a ‘both-sides’ narrative that dilutes clearer aggressor–victim lines, a stance that resonates with audiences wary of taking sides because of economic or geopolitical interests.

- **Trump-friendly/populist media (ProtoThema English)**: The focus is on President Trump’s possible attendance, casting his presence as pivotal to coaxing both Putin and Zelenskyy to the table and implying U.S. pressure is the key lever for peace. The article amplifies Trump’s personal agency and downplays structural issues in the war, reflecting an incentive to present the former as indispensable and glossing over criticism of his equivocal stance toward Russia.
