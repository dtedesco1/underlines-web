# ISRO’s PSLV-C61 Third-Stage Anomaly Halts EOS-09 Launch

On 18 May 2025, a sudden chamber-pressure drop in PSLV-C61’s solid third stage aborted India’s EOS-09 mission, registering the workhorse rocket’s first failure since 2017 and only its third in 32 years.

#### Focusing Facts

- The pressure loss occurred about 12 minutes after the 5:59 a.m. IST liftoff, making this just the 3rd failure in 63 PSLV launches since the rocket’s debut in 1993.

- EOS-09, a 1-tonne C-band SAR satellite slated for a 600 km sun-synchronous orbit, never achieved separation and is presumed to have fallen into the sea from ~450 km altitude.

- The attempt was the 101st orbital mission launched from Sriharikota and the 27th flight of the higher-thrust PSLV-XL variant.

#### Context

Rocket fleets inevitably suffer infrequent setbacks: Europe’s Ariane 5 maiden flight in June 1996 and Japan’s H-II F8 loss in November 1999 both stemmed from upper-stage anomalies striking long-boasted reliability records. PSLV’s slip after eight flawless years fits that pattern, reminding engineers that solid-motor aging, process drift and supply-chain substitutions can ambush even mature systems. Strategically, India’s 2020s push—from Chandrayaan-3’s lunar landing to aggressive commercial rideshare deals—depends on sustaining a reputation for cut-rate dependability; a fresh Failure Analysis Committee will test whether institutional learning, honed since the 1993 PSLV-D1 mishap, still functions in an era of rapid launch cadence and private suppliers. On a century scale, the incident is minor yet instructive: nations that embed transparent failure review (as the U.S. did post-Apollo 1 in 1967 or China after Long March 7A’s 2020 loss) tend to convert misfires into technological depth, thereby compounding reliability and geopolitical soft power in the decades-long race for orbital infrastructure and lunar resource access.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Indian mainstream and business media**: They depict the PSLV-C61 glitch as only the launch vehicle’s third misstep in 63 flights, hailing the rocket as ISRO’s "trusted workhorse" and stressing that setbacks are valuable lessons on the road to bigger successes. The upbeat tone nurtures national pride, downplays the seriousness of the failure and shields ISRO’s reputation—an incentive for outlets that rely on continued access to the space agency and an enthusiastic domestic audience.

- **International outlets headquartered outside India**: Coverage highlights the launch’s failure while contextualising India’s space ambitions as impressive for a "comparatively low-budget" programme that is "rapidly closing in" on major space powers. By stressing budget constraints and the word "setback," the reporting tempers recent hype about India’s rise in space and reinforces a narrative of developmental limits, a perspective shaped by distance from domestic patriotic sentiment.

- **Pakistani media**: Reporting underscores that the mission’s collapse thwarted deployment of a radar satellite touted for intelligence along India’s borders with Pakistan and China, framing the launch chiefly as a security-related failure. Highlighting the military implications of India’s mishap caters to regional rivalry and domestic audiences keen to see Indian technological ambitions checked, potentially amplifying schadenfreude over the malfunction.
