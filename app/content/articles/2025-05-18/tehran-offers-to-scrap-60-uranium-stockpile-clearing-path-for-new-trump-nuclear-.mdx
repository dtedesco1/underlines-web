# Tehran Offers to Scrap 60 % Uranium Stockpile, Clearing Path for New Trump Nuclear Deal

Between 14–15 May 2025, senior adviser Ali Shamkhani said Iran would eliminate its weapons-grade-capable uranium and cap enrichment at civilian levels under intrusive inspections if all U.S. sanctions are lifted, after which President Trump declared a deal was “very close.”

#### Focusing Facts

- IAEA March 2025 report: Iran’s 60 % enriched stockpile jumped to 275 kg from 182 kg, giving an estimated three-week breakout time.

- Fourth U.S.–Iran negotiation round in Muscat on 11 May 2025 lasted over three hours; envoy Steve Witkoff called the session “encouraging.”

- Speaking in Doha on 15 May 2025, Trump said Iran had “sort of agreed” to zero weapons capability, hinting a strike could be avoided.

#### Context

Iran’s public offer echoes South Africa’s 1989-91 voluntary dismantlement when sanctions pinched, and recalls the 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea that collapsed after a U.S. political shift. It illustrates a long arc: since the 1968 NPT, emerging powers brandish enrichment as leverage, while Washington cycles between pressure and pacts. Today’s concession suggests Trump’s mix of sanctions and threat dynamics can still squeeze movement, yet the JCPOA’s 2018 unraveling warns how leader turnover can void signatures. If a deal holds, it would briefly reinforce the non-proliferation norm and slow a Gulf nuclear cascade; if it fails, future historians may tag May 2025 as the moment multipolar deterrence began to outstrip treaty-based control.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media (e.g., Fox News, The Western Journal, Breitbart)**: Portrays Tehran’s reported concessions as proof that President Trump’s "maximum pressure" and threat of force have forced a climb-down, stressing that Iran is already a threshold nuclear state and must be stopped or its facilities dismantled. By celebrating Trump’s toughness and highlighting worst-case nuclear scenarios, these outlets amplify fear and credit the White House while glossing over remaining disagreements and the similarities to the 2015 Obama deal they once condemned.

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The Guardian)**: Frames the moment as a genuine diplomatic opening, emphasising Iranian proposals such as a regional enrichment consortium and suggesting US or Israeli hard-liners could still derail an otherwise workable compromise. Focus on creative diplomatic solutions and sanction relief risks downplaying the proliferation danger and Iran’s past breaches while subtly casting Washington as the primary obstacle. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/13/iran-proposes-partnership-with-uae-and-saudi-arabia-to-enrich-uranium), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/15/us-has-sort-of-agreed-a-nuclear-deal-with-iran-says-donald-trump))

- **Mainstream broadcast networks/public broadcasters (e.g., NBC News, BBC)**: Report that both sides describe talks as "encouraging" and quote senior Iranian adviser Ali Shamkhani offering to scrap highly enriched uranium in return for full sanctions relief, noting Trump’s claim a deal is "close." Heavy reliance on officials’ on-the-record comments may inadvertently give spin from both governments equal weight and understate the remaining technical and political hurdles.
