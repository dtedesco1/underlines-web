# Pope Leo XIV Launches Papacy with 250,000-Person Inaugural Mass at St Peter’s

On 18 May 2025, Illinois-born Cardinal Robert Prevost formally began his reign as Pope Leo XIV by celebrating an inauguration Mass before a quarter-million pilgrims and scores of world leaders in St. Peter’s Square.

#### Focusing Facts

- An estimated 250,000 people, including heads of state such as U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy, attended the ceremony in Rome on 18 May 2025.

- Leo XIV, elected after a 26-hour conclave on 8 May, is the first U.S.–born pontiff in the Church’s 2,000-year history.

- The Vatican currently faces a $112 million annual deficit and a $2.2 billion unfunded pension liability inherited from the Francis era.

#### Context

The scene echoed 22 October 1978, when John Paul II—first non-Italian in 455 years—drew vast crowds and re-oriented Cold-War geopolitics; like then, the cardinals again broke precedent to address a crisis of credibility and finances. Leo’s rise reflects long-running trends: the shift of Catholic influence toward the Americas, the Church’s dependence on U.S. money, and the deepening ideological polarization that mirrors secular politics. His mix of traditional liturgical signals (Latin prayers, papal palace residence) and Francis-style social rhetoric on migrants and climate suggests a strategy to stitch together factions while keeping the global south’s social-justice agenda alive. Over a century horizon, installing an American pope during a populist U.S. presidency could either entangle the papacy more tightly in U.S. culture wars or, conversely, internationalize Catholicism beyond nationalist frames—decisions that will shape doctrine, finances and diplomatic clout well past Leo’s tenure.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media (e.g., New York Post)**: See Leo as the long-awaited disciplinarian who will sweep away Francis’s doctrinal confusion, revive tradition and reopen donors’ wallets. Frames Francis almost solely as a liberal wrecking-ball and assumes Leo will side with conservatives, glossing over social-justice themes that clash with the outlet’s politics.

- **Left leaning media (e.g., The Guardian, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Vanity Fair)**: Argue that Leo largely shares Francis’s concern for migrants, the poor and the environment and could even stand as a "woke" foil to Trump-style nationalism. Cast MAGA Catholics as reactionary villains and celebrate hints of progressivism, risking an overly rosy reading of Leo’s still-traditional stances on issues such as women’s ordination or abortion.

- **Mainstream U.S. establishment outlets (e.g., The New York Times, Washington Post, BBC, USA Today)**: Present Leo as a conciliatory, pragmatic American pope whose success will hinge on bridging fractures between conservative U.S. Catholics and the Vatican while boosting church popularity. Tend to filter the papacy through a U.S. political lens—treating it like a geopolitical horse race—which can downplay theological substance and inflate the significance of Washington personalities.
