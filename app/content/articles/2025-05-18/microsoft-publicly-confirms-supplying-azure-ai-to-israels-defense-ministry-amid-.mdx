# Microsoft Publicly Confirms Supplying Azure & AI to Israel’s Defense Ministry Amid Gaza War

On 16–17 May 2025 Microsoft issued its first public statement acknowledging it sold Azure cloud and AI tools to Israel’s military during the Gaza conflict and, after an internal + external probe, asserted it found “no evidence” the tech was used to harm Gaza civilians.

#### Focusing Facts

- The statement followed an investigation that interviewed “dozens of employees” and reviewed documents, yet Microsoft conceded it lacks visibility on customer on-premise or third-party cloud use of its software.

- Associated Press data showed Israeli military consumption of commercial AI services, mostly via Azure, jumped almost 200-fold after the 7 Oct 2023 Hamas attack.

- Microsoft provided “limited emergency support” beyond normal contracts to assist hostage-rescue operations, approving some IMOD requests and rejecting others.

#### Context

Big tech’s entanglement with warfare echoes IBM’s 1930s–40s punch-card systems sold to governments, illustrating how civilian information technology repeatedly migrates into military hands once crises hit.  Since the 1990s shift toward outsourced IT, Western militaries have leaned on commercial clouds; Project Maven (Google, 2018) and the Pentagon’s JEDI saga (Microsoft, 2019-21) signaled this trajectory.  Microsoft’s attempt to dictate an Acceptable Use Policy to a nation-state hints at an emergent norm where private firms, not treaties, set the guard-rails of algorithmic conflict—a power inversion with unclear enforcement.  Over a 100-year horizon, this moment matters because it marks another step toward privatized, opaque AI-driven targeting infrastructures whose accountability rests on corporate self-audit rather than international law, potentially reshaping sovereignty and the laws of war in the digital century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Tech industry and gadget press (e.g., The Verge, Neowin, The Times of India Tech Desk)**: Accepts Microsoft’s internal investigation at face value, stressing the finding that Azure and AI tools were not used to harm Gaza civilians and presenting the IMOD contract as a routine commercial deal. Coverage leans corporate-friendly, largely relies on Microsoft’s own statement with little independent verification, downplaying unanswered questions flagged elsewhere.

- **Middle-Eastern outlets critical of Israel (e.g., Anadolu Ajansı, Arab News)**: Highlight the public backlash and human-rights concerns over Microsoft’s support for the Israeli military, noting fears that its AI could enable civilian casualties despite the firm’s denials. Regional sympathy for Palestinians and political opposition to Israeli actions may lead these outlets to foreground worst-case scenarios and under-represent Microsoft’s stated safeguards.

- **Israeli mainstream media (e.g., Haaretz, ynetnews)**: Report Microsoft’s aid to the Israeli military mainly in the context of rescuing hostages while repeating the company’s assurance that the tech was not used to harm civilians. National perspective encourages framing the partnership as life-saving for Israelis and deemphasises extensive Palestinian casualties or activist criticism.
