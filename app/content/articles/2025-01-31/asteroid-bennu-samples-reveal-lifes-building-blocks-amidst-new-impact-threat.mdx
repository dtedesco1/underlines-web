# Asteroid Bennu Samples Reveal Life's Building Blocks Amidst New Impact Threat

NASA and ESA are examining samples from asteroid Bennu, containing DNA nucleobases and amino acids crucial for life, while concurrently monitoring asteroid 2024 YR4, which has a 1.3% chance of hitting Earth in 2032.

#### Focusing Facts

- Asteroid Bennu samples, retrieved by OSIRIS-REx, contain all five DNA and RNA nucleobases and 14 amino acids.

- Asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 1.3% chance of colliding with Earth on December 22, 2032, rated 3 on the Torino scale.

- OSIRIS-REx was NASA's first mission to return asteroid samples to Earth, landing them in Utah in 2023.

#### Context

The discovery of life's building blocks in asteroid Bennu samples harks back to the theory that Earth's essential organic compounds may have been delivered by asteroids or comets during the Late Heavy Bombardment (approximately 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago) when meteor impacts were more common. The OSIRIS-REx mission follows in the footsteps of Japan's Hayabusa, which returned samples from asteroid Itokawa in 2010, marking a new era of planetary science focusing on direct extraterrestrial material study. Concurrently, the 2024 YR4 asteroid threat revives concerns reminiscent of the Tunguska event in 1908, prompting the development of planetary defense strategies. While this dual event emphasizes humanity's growing capability to both learn from and mitigate extraterrestrial threats, it reflects enduring challenges in predicting precise cosmic impacts and understanding life's originsâ€”a mystery that could remain unresolved for centuries.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Scientific Media Outlets**: The discovery of organic molecules in the Bennu asteroid samples suggests that essential ingredients for life may have been widespread in the early solar system, supporting theories of life-originating chemistry via asteroid impacts. Such outlets may emphasize the significance of the findings to promote interest and funding in space exploration and research.

- **Mainstream Media Outlets**: The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a chance of impacting Earth in 2032, but the risk is currently low and likely to be revised as more data is collected. These outlets might sensationalize the potential impact to increase readership and engagement, while still providing reassurance through expert opinions.

- **Local European Media**: The European Space Agency's tracking of asteroid 2024 YR4 indicates an elevated initial risk of impact in 2032, but this is expected to be corrected with further observations. These media sources may focus on European efforts and contributions to the tracking and defense against such potential impacts, highlighting ESA's role in global response strategies.
