# Meta Settles with Trump for $25 Million Over Account Suspension

Meta has agreed to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit with Donald Trump over the suspension of his social media accounts after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, with the majority of the funds allocated to his presidential library.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump signed the settlement agreement on January 29, 2025, in the Oval Office.

- $22 million of the settlement will go toward Trump's presidential library fund.

- Meta's suspension of Trump's accounts lasted for two years, from January 2021 to January 2023.

#### Context

This settlement reflects a broader trend of reassessing the role of tech companies in moderating political contentâ€”a debate reminiscent of controversies surrounding media influence on public discourse, akin to the 1920s opposition to media consolidation, where regulation was imposed to curtail monopolistic practices. The willingness of major corporations to settle lawsuits and mend relationships with Trump, as seen with Meta and ABC, signifies a shift in corporate strategies to align with political powers, echoing patterns from historical political-economic alliances. Over a long horizon, this event marks a point in the ongoing negotiation between freedom of expression and corporate responsibility, themes that will likely endure over the next century as technology continues to evolve within the political sphere.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream media**: The settlement between Meta and Trump is seen as a strategic move by Meta to improve its relationship with the current U.S. administration, reflecting its interest in maintaining influence and favorable regulation by the government. This group might downplay any negative ramifications of such settlements on social media governance and may not critically address the implications of corporate power and free speech.

- **Right-leaning media**: Meta's settlement with Trump as a victory for conservative voices which were wrongfully censored after the January 6 attack, with a focus on the supposed biases of social media companies against conservative ideologies. This group's narrative may exacerbate the polarization regarding tech censorship and ignore Meta's potential motives to appease the sitting administration.

- **Left-leaning media**: The settlement as Meta's capitulation to Trump's influence and a concern over weakening content moderation efforts that could allow misinformation to prosper. This perspective could overemphasize the threat posed by such settlements to democratic discourse, while underestimating the complexities of balancing free speech and regulation.
