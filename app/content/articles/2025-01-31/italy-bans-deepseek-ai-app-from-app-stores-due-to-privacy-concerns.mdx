# Italy Bans DeepSeek AI App from App Stores Due to Privacy Concerns

Italy's data regulator removed the DeepSeek AI app from Apple and Google stores over privacy concerns about data storage in China.

#### Focusing Facts

- The Italian Data Protection Authority launched an investigation on January 28, 2025.

- DeepSeek has around 5-6 million users worldwide, with 3 million downloads since launch.

- Ireland also sought information on DeepSeek's data processing for Irish citizens.

#### Context

The removal of DeepSeek from Italian app stores can be analogized to Italy's 2023 temporary ban on ChatGPT due to GDPR compliance issues. This reflects a broader international trend where governments scrutinize Chinese tech companies regarding user data and privacy amid escalating digital sovereignty concerns. As global reliance on digital tools increases, data privacy regulations are becoming one of the defining arenas in geopolitical tech conflicts. On a century-long timescale, events like this could significantly shape the evolution of global data privacy norms and how national security intersects with information technology, as countries strive to balance openness with protection of sensitive data against foreign access.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US national security and military experts**: DeepSeek is perceived as a national security threat because it collects sensitive user data and stores it in China, raising concerns it could be used for surveillance similar to TikTok. The focus on security threats may be influenced by broader geopolitical tensions between the US and China, potentially overlooking or downplaying DeepSeek's technological innovations.

- **Italian and European data protection authorities**: DeepSeek's data handling practices are potentially in violation of European GDPR laws, posing a privacy risk to millions. Their strict stance reflects ongoing regulatory efforts within the EU to maintain strong data protection standards, which may sometimes conflict with global technology advancements.

- **Tech industry commentators**: DeepSeek offers a competitive and low-cost AI model but its data practices, including keystroke logging, are deeply concerning for user privacy. There may be a focus on the sensational aspects of DeepSeek's data collection practices to drive readership, possibly overshadowing the broader implications for AI development.
