# World Court Opens Hearings on Israel’s Aid Blockade and UNRWA Ban

On 28 April 2025 the International Court of Justice began five-days of hearings—requested by the UN General Assembly—to decide whether Israel’s 2 March total aid cutoff and January ban on UNRWA violate its legal duties toward Gaza’s 2.3 million civilians.

#### Focusing Facts

- Forty states and four international organisations are scheduled to address the ICJ panel between 28 April and 2 May 2025; Israel declined to appear but filed written objections.

- Israel’s full closure has stopped all food, fuel and medicines from entering Gaza since 2 March 2025, after which UN-supported bakeries and World Food Programme stocks were exhausted within four weeks.

- Two Israeli laws passed in October 2024 labelled UNRWA a terrorist-linked body and barred visas or cooperation, triggering the UN request for the advisory opinion.

#### Context

This hearing echoes the ICJ’s 1971 advisory opinion on South West Africa (Namibia), when the Court clarified an occupying power’s duties despite that power’s boycott of proceedings; like South Africa then, Israel now bets that facts on the ground will outweigh legal censure.  Strategically, the case sits at the confluence of two long trends: (1) the use of international courts as arenas for ‘lawfare’ when diplomatic channels stall, visible from Nicaragua v. United States (1986) to Ukraine v. Russia (2022); and (2) the slow erosion of deference to UN agencies as major powers prioritise security narratives over multilateral norms.  If the Court affirms a duty to facilitate aid, it could tighten the customary law around siege warfare and UN immunities—constraints that, over a century, shape how states wage war and treat civilians.  Conversely, open defiance by Israel (and any shielding vetoes at the Security Council) would underline the enforcement gap that has dogged collective security since the League of Nations, reinforcing a precedent that great or well-connected powers can outlast juridical condemnation.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media (Al Jazeera Online, The Guardian, Common Dreams)**: Frame the ICJ hearings as evidence that Israel is deliberately starving Gazans in a "livestreamed genocide" and must be forced to obey humanitarian law. Their reporting heavily foregrounds Palestinian testimony and rights-group language, giving little space to Israeli security arguments or corroboration of claims about UNRWA innocence.

- **Public broadcasters and international news agencies (BBC, RTE.ie, The Independent)**: Present the case primarily as a landmark legal test of Israel’s duties under international law to facilitate aid, noting both the humanitarian collapse and Israel’s written denials. In pursuing balance they echo Israeli statements alongside UN data, which can dilute the urgency of alleged war-crimes and leave power imbalances under-examined.

- **Centrist outlets amplifying Israeli official narrative (The Globe and Mail, Sky News)**: Highlight Israeli officials’ charge that the ICJ process is a politicised attack that ignores Hamas infiltration of UNRWA and Israel’s basic right to defend itself. By prominently airing allegations about UNRWA and framing Israel as victim of UN persecution, they risk legitimising unverified claims and shifting focus away from humanitarian impacts.
