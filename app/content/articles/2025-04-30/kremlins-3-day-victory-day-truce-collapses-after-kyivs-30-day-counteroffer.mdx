# Kremlin’s 3-Day Victory Day Truce Collapses After Kyiv’s 30-Day Counteroffer

On 29 April 2025 Moscow declared a unilateral ceasefire for 8–10 May but within 24 hours rejected Ukraine’s request to turn it into an immediate 30-day halt and demanded Kyiv first lift its 2022 legal ban on talks with Putin.

#### Focusing Facts

- Putin’s ceasefire window was announced for 00:00 May 8 to 24:00 May 10, framed as a “gesture of goodwill” ahead of Russia’s 80th Victory Day parade.

- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov publicly dismissed Zelensky’s 30-day proposal on 29 April, citing unanswered conditions such as a stop to Western arms and a ban on Ukrainian force regrouping.

- Russia and Ukraine have not held direct negotiations since March 2022, after Zelensky’s October 2022 decree forbidding talks with Putin.

#### Context

Short holiday truces that founder on maximalist demands echo the 1916 First World War ‘Christmas truces’, brief respites that changed none of the war aims.  A century later, the same pattern—symbolic pauses timed to national rituals—serves propaganda more than peacemaking.  The Kremlin’s offer fits a longer Russian tradition of leveraging commemorations (e.g., the 2008 August ceasefire in Georgia during the Beijing Olympics) to seize moral high ground while preserving battlefield momentum.  Kyiv’s insistence on a longer, enforceable halt reflects the post-Cold-War trend of smaller states seeking multilateral guarantees before conceding territory, aware of how the 1938 Munich deal or the 2014 Minsk accords unraveled once great-power attention drifted.  Whether this moment matters hinges on if external mediators can shift incentives: absent sustained pressure, it likely registers as another tactical feint in a grinding conflict, but if it hardens international fatigue and normalizes piecemeal ceasefires without settlement, it could shape norms of limited war for decades.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Russian state-owned media (e.g., RT)**: Frame Moscow as ready for unconditional talks and portray Kyiv’s refusal to lift its legal ban on negotiating with Putin as the main obstacle to peace. Echoes Kremlin messaging that shifts responsibility for the ongoing war onto Ukraine while glossing over Russia’s territorial demands and continued attacks, as shown in multiple RT dispatches.

- **Western liberal or international outlets critical of Russia (e.g., The Atlantic, Meduza, Al Jazeera)**: Depict Putin’s cease-fire offer as a manipulative stunt and argue that Russia is stonewalling substantive concessions while Trump fails to leverage U.S. power to curb Moscow. Emphasise Russian bad faith and Trump’s shortcomings, potentially underplaying any Ukrainian inflexibility or Western strategic interests in prolonging support, as reflected across their coverage.

- **Right-leaning U.S./UK media sympathetic to Trump’s mediation efforts (e.g., Washington Examiner, Express)**: Highlight Zelensky’s rejection of the three-day truce and stress the Trump administration’s frustration, framing Kyiv’s stance as a setback to ending the war. Tends to echo Trump-era talking points and cast Ukrainian resistance as the chief hurdle, while offering limited scrutiny of Russian conditions or cease-fire violations, as their reports indicate.
