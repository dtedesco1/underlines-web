# BRICS Foreign Ministers in Rio Forge Joint Anti-Tariff Declaration, Shelve Single Currency Push

On 28–29 Apr 2025, ministers from the now-11-member BRICS bloc met in Rio de Janeiro, agreed to issue a statement condemning President Trump’s new tariff barrage and vowed to expand national-currency trade, but put plans for a unified BRICS currency on hold.

#### Focusing Facts

- Foreign ministers from all 11 BRICS members plus 9 partner states gathered in Rio on 28–29 Apr 2025, the last ministerial before the July leaders’ summit.

- Draft communiqué denounces U.S. ‘unilateral measures’ imposed since Jan 2025: a blanket 10 % tariff on most countries and up to 145 % on Chinese exports.

- Sergey Lavrov told O Globo that a common BRICS currency is ‘premature,’ though the bloc will keep increasing the share of national currencies in settlements.

#### Context

The gathering recalls the 1961 Belgrade Non-Aligned Conference when emerging states first coordinated against great-power economic coercion, and it sits in a lineage that includes the 1971 Nixon-shock dollar break and the 1999 euro launch—moments when the global monetary order was pried open.  The Rio meeting signals two structural trends: (1) accelerating fragmentation of the U.S-centric trade and payments system hinted at since the 2008 financial crisis and BRICS’ own New Development Bank in 2014, and (2) the South’s demographic-economic weight (40 % of people, 35 % of GDP) finally turning into collective bargaining.  Whether this matters in a 100-year frame hinges on follow-through: previous attempts at alternative payment blocs—the Chiang Mai Initiative (2000) or the GCC common currency (abandoned 2010)—stalled once external pressure eased and internal rivalries resurfaced.  If BRICS converts today’s anti-tariff posture into concrete settlement platforms, the 2025 Rio meeting could mark the slow erosion of the dollar’s post-Bretton-Woods dominance; if not, it may be footnoted as another episodic protest against a protectionist White House.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Russian state-owned media (e.g., TASS)**: Portrays BRICS monetary cooperation as a long-term project while stressing that the real, immediate trend is global 'dedollarisation' driven by lost trust in Western financial institutions. Echoes the Kremlin’s strategic messaging that shifts blame for economic friction onto the West and minimizes internal BRICS doubts, reinforcing Moscow’s narrative of rising multipolarity.

- **Western mainstream business press (e.g., Reuters, International Business Times)**: Frames the Rio meeting as a coordinated but measured attempt by BRICS to defend the multilateral trade system and to craft a joint statement critiquing U.S. tariffs without escalating confrontation. Tends to foreground procedural diplomacy and market repercussions, downplaying the bloc’s anti-U.S. rhetoric to maintain a tone of neutrality that appeals to global investors and policymakers.

- **Pro-China or Global South outlets sympathetic to Beijing’s stance (e.g., Yeni Şafak, Anadolu Ajansı)**: Amplifies Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s warning that yielding to Washington’s tariff pressure will 'only embolden the bully' and calls on BRICS to unite against all forms of U.S. protectionism. Mirrors Beijing’s talking points by casting the U.S. as the sole aggressor and glossing over China’s own retaliatory tariffs or the complexities of global trade rules, fostering an us-versus-them narrative.
