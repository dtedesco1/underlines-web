# Microsoft Positions Windows 11 24H2 as "Most Reliable Ever" While Rushing Patches, EU-Style Debloat Tools and Migration Features

In the same week Microsoft boasted that Windows 11 24H2 slashes unexpected restarts by 24 %, it had to ship hot-fix KB5062660 for crashes and quietly enable EU Digital Markets Act debloat options and a new local-backup transfer tool as it prepares for Windows 10’s October 2025 end-of-life.

#### Focusing Facts

- Blog post (27 Jul 2025) claims Win11 24H2 cut “unexpected restarts” by 24 % versus Windows 10 22H2.

- Optional update KB5062660, published 22 Jul 2025, corrects stability bugs and game FPS drops introduced by mandatory patches KB5060842/KB5063060.

- DMA-compliant build lets users uninstall Edge and change default search; users can unlock it worldwide by rerunning OOBE via built-in sysprep without wiping data.

#### Context

Regulators and users have been here before: after Windows 95 bundled Internet Explorer, the 2000 EU antitrust case forced Microsoft to ship the 2004 “N” editions without Media Player. Two decades later, the Digital Markets Act is exerting a similar squeeze, prying Edge and Bing loose just as Microsoft doubles down on telemetry and AI-driven upsells. Simultaneously, the company is replaying its 2004 Windows XP SP2 moment—touting reliability gains while patching self-inflicted crashes. The scramble to polish Windows 11 before Windows 10’s October 2025 cutoff highlights a long arc: dominant platforms eventually face regulatory, technical and market push-back that compels real user-centric concessions. Whether these latest tweaks mark lasting change or another cycle of “trust us, patch later” will shape how operating-system power is distributed well into the mid-21st-century computing landscape.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Microsoft-friendly tech enthusiast outlets (e.g., Windows Central, Ubergizmo)**: Portray the forthcoming Windows 11 24H2 release as the most reliable Windows ever, encouraging Windows 10 users to upgrade for lower crash rates, faster recovery and seamless future updates. Dependence on Microsoft’s briefings and access encourages an upbeat narrative and downplays recently admitted 24H2 glitches that other outlets highlight.

- **Skeptical tech press highlighting Windows 11 flaws (e.g., The Register, PCWorld, Windows Latest)**: Argue that Windows 11 is packed with unwanted bloat, intrusive ads and still suffering stability problems, with recent cumulative updates even causing game crashes and BSODs despite Microsoft’s boasts. To attract a critical-minded readership these outlets emphasize worst-case failures and use inflammatory language, potentially under-representing users who experience few issues.

- **Power-user tweak & how-to sites (e.g., XDA-Developers, The How-To Geek)**: Focus on empowering users to ‘debloat’ or customize Windows 11—switching to EU setup regions, disabling telemetry, or altering hidden settings—to reclaim control and improve performance. Their tutorial-driven model benefits from spotlighting annoyances and hidden problems that their guides can solve, sometimes suggesting risky workarounds while assuming reader technical skill.
