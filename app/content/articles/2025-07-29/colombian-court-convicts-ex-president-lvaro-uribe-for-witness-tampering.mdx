# Colombian Court Convicts Ex-President Álvaro Uribe for Witness Tampering

On 28 July 2025, Judge Sandra Liliana Heredia declared former president Álvaro Uribe guilty of abuse of process and bribery of a public official after a 13-year probe into attempts to coerce jailed paramilitaries into altering testimony.

#### Focusing Facts

- Verdict delivered 28 Jul 2025 after a ten-hour reading; Uribe found guilty on two counts, acquitted on a third, becoming Colombia’s first ex-head of state convicted at trial.

- Each count carries 6-12 years; sentencing hearing scheduled for 1 Aug 2025, and Uribe, 73, remains free pending appeal.

- Trial opened 6 May 2024 with testimony from more than 90 witnesses; the written judgment runs roughly 1,000 pages.

#### Context

Latin America has periodically tried – and sometimes jailed – former leaders (Peru’s Fujimori in 2007, Brazil’s Lula in 2017, Ecuador’s Correa in absentia 2020). Colombia had avoided that pattern until now, largely because the security establishment was politically untouchable after the 1948-2016 armed conflict. Uribe’s conviction signals the slow erosion of that post-Cold-War immunity and the rising clout of institutions born of the 2016 peace accord and the 1991 constitution. Whether it sticks matters: in a century-long arc, nations that manage to subject ex-rulers to ordinary courts (post-1976 Argentina) tend to strengthen civilian control and reduce cycles of revenge; those that fail (post-1959 Cuba, 1990s Russia) see entrenched impunity. Yet the case also exposes ‘lawfare’ accusations, U.S. pressure, and Colombia’s hyper-polarisation ahead of 2026 elections. If the ruling survives appeal, it may become a precedent for prosecuting paramilitary collusion and the 6,400 ‘false-positive’ killings; if it is overturned, it could reinforce cynicism about selective justice. Either way, it nudges Colombia toward answering a century-old question: can a state forged in civil war restrain its own elites without triggering another round of violence?

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Global wire services (Reuters, U.S. News & World Report, Colorado Springs Gazette syndication)**: Frame Uribe’s conviction as an unprecedented triumph for Colombia’s rule-of-law, quoting the judge’s declaration that “justice has arrived” and underscoring the historic nature of jailing a former president. Because wires prioritise speed and broad market readership, they lean on official courtroom language and aim for balance, which can muffle deeper scrutiny of systemic political pressures or victims’ perspectives highlighted elsewhere.

- **Right-leaning/tabloid outlets sympathetic to Uribe (Daily Mail Online, Arab News)**: Present the case largely through Uribe’s lens of ‘political vengeance,’ stressing his conservative legacy, U.S. backing and Senator Marco Rubio’s charge that radical judges have ‘weaponised’ Colombia’s courts. Ideological affinity with Uribe’s hard-line security record leads these stories to spotlight accusations of judicial persecution while downplaying the documented paramilitary abuses and evidence the court weighed.

- **Regional and human-rights-focused outlets (RTL Today, The Manila Times, KTBS/AFP wire)**: Highlight the conviction as long-overdue accountability for a leader linked to paramilitary death squads, detailing civilian massacres, ‘false positives’ and victims’ search for truth. The emphasis on historic abuses and Petro-era reforms can echo Colombia’s current left-wing administration, giving limited airtime to due-process objections raised by Uribe’s defense or international conservatives.
