# Israel Begins 10-Hour Daily ‘Tactical Pauses’ and New Aid Corridors After Starvation Outcry

Starting 27 Jul 2025, the IDF is halting operations 10 a.m.–8 p.m. daily in Muwasi, Deir al-Balah and Gaza City and opening 06:00-23:00 secure routes to let U.N. and other convoys deliver food and medicine.

#### Focusing Facts

- Pause covers three zones and was negotiated with U.N. agencies; seven IDF airdrops and three Jordan-UAE airdrops took place on day one.

- Aid flows remain tiny: only 4,500 trucks (≈69/day) entered Gaza since mid-May, versus the 500-600/day the U.N. says are required.

- Israeli military officials told NYT (26 Jul 2025) they found no proof of systematic Hamas theft of U.N. aid, undermining the blockade’s stated rationale.

#### Context

Wars have weaponised food before—Britain’s 1943 Bengal rice embargo and Nigeria’s 1968 blockade of Biafra both triggered famine while combat continued—yet each later helped codify prohibitions on starvation in the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. Israel’s limited pauses echo the 1948 Berlin Airlift or 1984 Ethiopia airdrops, but on a fraction of the scale, and with the besieging power still gate-keeping supply. The move fits a century-long trend of siege warfare shifting from encirclement by armies to bureaucratic throttling of supply chains; it also shows the rise of privatized humanitarian logistics (the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation) replacing multilateral mechanisms. Whether this moment matters in 2125 depends on if it entrenches ‘managed famine’ as an accepted coercive tool or triggers stronger international enforcement against using starvation in conflict—something previous famines failed to accomplish despite global outrage.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left-leaning Western media (e.g., ITV News, The Guardian)**: They depict Gaza’s hunger as a deliberate consequence of Israel’s blockade; limited aid drops or brief "tactical pauses" are portrayed as symbolic and only a full cease-fire and lifting of restrictions can avert mass starvation. Coverage leans heavily on emotive eyewitness accounts and casts Israel as the principal, almost sole, villain, giving little space to Hamas’s actions or logistical challenges, potentially amplifying outrage while simplifying a complex war. ([ITV Hub](https://www.itv.com/news/2025-07-27/more-aid-is-good-news-but-only-a-gaza-ceasefire-will-really-make-a-difference), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/28/gaza-israel-aid-starvation-children))

- **Indian broadcast outlets reporting straight news (NDTV)**: They frame the 10-hour daily "tactical pause" as a concrete step announced by the Israeli army to ease Gaza’s humanitarian crisis, relaying official details about locations, timings and airdrops. By largely echoing the IDF communiqués and avoiding pointed criticism, the reports risk normalising Israel’s narrative and may underplay the scale of starvation or questions about the pause’s adequacy.

- **Right-leaning U.S. political voices (Donald Trump, quoted via DT News)**: They spotlight an American-led plan to open food centres, stressing the need to feed children before politics and praising ongoing cooperation with Israeli leaders. The messaging burnishes Trump’s humanitarian credentials while skirting Israel’s responsibility for the blockade and portraying aid delivery as a U.S. goodwill gesture that can be implemented without confronting the underlying conflict.
