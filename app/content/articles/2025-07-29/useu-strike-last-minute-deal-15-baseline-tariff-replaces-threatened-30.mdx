# US–EU Strike Last-Minute Deal: 15 % Baseline Tariff Replaces Threatened 30 %

After a one-hour meeting at Trump Turnberry on 27 July 2025, President Trump dropped his planned 30 % EU duty and settled on a 15 % across-the-board tariff, averting a trans-Atlantic trade war days before the 1 August deadline.

#### Focusing Facts

- EU pledged to buy roughly $750 billion of U.S. energy exports over the coming years.

- European Commission agreed to funnel an additional $600 billion in direct investment into the United States.

- The pre-existing 50 % U.S. tariff on European steel and aluminum stays untouched, with quotas still being discussed.

#### Context

Washington coercing concessions through tariff deadlines echoes the 1971 Nixon import surcharge and, further back, the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act that triggered cascading retaliation; yet today’s 15 % rate is well below Smoot-Hawley’s average 40 %, suggesting disruption rather than collapse.  The episode typifies a decade-long drift from multilateral WTO rule-sets toward ad-hoc bilateral bargains where market access is traded for energy and arms purchases, reminiscent of the 1985 Plaza Accord’s leverage but now centered on tariffs instead of currencies.  Long-term, the deal signals entrenchment of “weaponised interdependence”: big economies can impose uniform levies, then rebate them selectively, creating de facto spheres of privileged supply.  If this pattern persists, the post-1995 rules-based trade order may, by 2125, read like a brief interlude between two eras of tariff-managed blocs; whether 15 % becomes a global norm or a tactical ceiling will shape the next century of supply-chain geography.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Pro-Trump conservative/alternative media (InfoWars, New York Post)**: Frames the agreement as President Trump’s single biggest accomplishment, touting eye-popping EU commitments on energy, investment and arms purchases while celebrating the 15 % tariff as proof of hard-nosed negotiating that avoided a trade war. Coverage amplifies Trump’s self-declared numbers with little verification and portrays the outcome as an unequivocal win, reflecting a partisan incentive to bolster the president’s image and drive engagement—right down to plugging merchandise sales.

- **Mainstream global business and broadcast outlets (CNBC, ITV, NDTV)**: Report the deal as a last-minute compromise that heads off a damaging tariff escalation, noting the reduced 15 % levy and limited details after a brief meeting in Scotland. The largely descriptive tone leans on official press remarks and avoids deeper scrutiny of economic fallout, reflecting a conventional news-wire impulse to appear balanced but potentially downplaying consumer cost concerns raised by analysts in other pieces.

- **Middle-East regional press (DT News Bahrain)**: Stresses the uncertainty surrounding negotiations, earlier highlighting only a ‘50 / 50 chance’ of success and later pointing out that tariffs are effectively a sales tax borne by U.S. consumers even under the new pact. By spotlighting the risks and the mechanics of who pays tariffs, the coverage injects a sceptical economic angle—yet it relies heavily on syndicated material and may echo regional interests in stable global trade flows rather than U.S. political optics.
