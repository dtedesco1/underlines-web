# Stockholm Talks Aim to Push US–China Tariff Truce 90 Days Past Aug-12 Cliff

For the first time since June, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s Vice-Premier He Lifeng met 27-28 July 2025 in Stockholm to negotiate a fresh three-month reprieve before triple-digit tariffs automatically snap back on 12 August.

#### Focusing Facts

- Venue & principals: Rosenbad, Stockholm, 27–28 Jul 2025; U.S. side led by Scott Bessent, Chinese side by He Lifeng.

- Existing truce—US tariffs 30%, Chinese tariffs 10%—expires 12 Aug 2025, when rates would rebound to ~145% and 125% respectively.

- Reuters and SCMP sources say both delegations have tentatively agreed to a 90-day extension, preventing new duties while leaders prepare a possible Trump–Xi summit in Oct–Nov.

#### Context

Big-power trade truces are nothing new: the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act lifted U.S. duties to ~45%, sparking a spiral of retaliatory levies eerily echoed in this cycle, while the 1985 Plaza Accord shows how brinkmanship can morph into negotiated realignment once leverage is established.  Today’s talks sit at the intersection of two structural trends: (1) the weaponisation of supply chains—rare-earth magnets and AI chips now fill the role oil played in the 1973 embargo—and (2) the return of managed bilateralism after the post-1995 multilateral WTO era.  If a second 90-day pause sticks, it signals that neither Washington nor Beijing is ready for an outright economic divorce, yet both are comfortable normalising tariff ceilings unseen since the Depression.  On a century horizon, such iterative truces could either mirror early 20th-century naval treaties—temporary caps before larger conflict—or become the scaffolding for a new, fragmented trade architecture where ad-hoc deals trump global rules.  Markets cheer the stay of execution, but history warns that repeated extensions without structural resolution can entrench protectionism rather than end it.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning US media (Fox Business, The Daily Caller)**: They frame the Stockholm negotiations as vindication of Trump’s tough-tariff playbook and say an extension is likely because Beijing is already conceding on rare-earths, fentanyl and tech sales. The coverage applauds Trump and foregrounds Chinese wrongdoing, reflecting partisan incentives to credit the president’s strategy while glossing over the tariffs’ economic costs at home.

- **Global wire and finance outlets (Reuters, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance)**: Reports emphasise that markets simply want another 90-day pause and caution that the meeting is unlikely to solve the deeper structural disputes behind the trade war. By prioritising market reaction and analyst commentary, they adopt an investor-centric lens that may understate wider political stakes or labour impacts.

- **Asian & Middle-Eastern regional press (Malay Mail, DT News, Times of India)**: Stories stress that many countries are racing to cut deals before U.S. tariff deadlines and cast the Stockholm talks as one piece of a wider scramble to avoid painful hikes that could hit their own economies. This perspective centres regional economic vulnerability, painting Washington as the disruptor and potentially exaggerating external harm while giving little attention to U.S. complaints about China.
