# Cyberstrike Grounds Aeroflot: Silent Crow Hack Cancels 50+ Flights

On 28 July 2025, a confirmed cyber-attack crippled Aeroflot’s core IT systems, forcing the airline to cancel scores of flights and prompting Russian prosecutors to open a criminal investigation.

#### Focusing Facts

- Aeroflot’s Telegram updates listed 52 flight cancellations—mostly domestic but also routes to Minsk, Yerevan and Tashkent—plus over 10 delays.

- Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office formally launched an inquiry into “unauthorised access” to Aeroflot’s systems on 28 July 2025, publicly attributing the disruption to a hacker attack.

- The pro-Ukraine group Silent Crow claims it destroyed about 7,000 servers and stole 12 TB of databases, 8 TB of internal files and 2 TB of email during a year-long infiltration, though evidence remains unverified.

#### Context

Civilian air travel has rarely been directly disabled by hackers since the 2015 breach of Poland’s LOT airline, yet the tactic echoes earlier digital offensives such as the 2007 Estonia DDoS campaign and the 2017 NotPetya worm that paralyzed Maersk’s logistics network. This incident fits a post-2022 pattern in which the Russia-Ukraine war bleeds into cyberspace, with loosely affiliated ‘hacktivists’ acting as proxy combatants and targeting high-visibility civilian infrastructure to erode morale rather than achieve immediate military gain. The strike underscores two structural shifts: (1) aviation’s deep dependence on interconnected, often legacy IT stacks, and (2) the blurring line between volunteer activism and state-sponsored cyber operations, reminiscent of privateering in the age of sail. Whether Silent Crow’s reported 7,000-server wipe is hype or reality, the episode signals that future wars may routinely ground planes or shut hospitals without a single missile fired. On a century horizon, this is another data point suggesting that the critical choke-points of modern societies—transport, energy, finance—could become primary battlegrounds, making resilient digital infrastructure as strategic as oil fields were in the 20th century.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western mainstream media (BBC, Reuters, The Guardian, NBC, Bloomberg Business)**: Aeroflot was forced to cancel dozens of flights after an IT failure that a pro-Ukraine hacker group says it caused, though the scale of the breach remains unverified. Coverage stresses Russia’s vulnerability and links the incident to the Ukraine war while repeatedly noting the hackers’ claims are unconfirmed, reflecting a Western outlook that can underplay Russia’s version of events. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87e0ydy3d4o), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/en/russias-aeroflot-suffers-it-failure-hackers-claim-responsibility-2025-07-28/))

- **Ukrainian national outlets (Українська правда, Ukrinform)**: The cyber-attack is presented as a successful, year-long pro-Ukrainian operation that destroyed 7,000 servers and dealt ‘strategic’ damage to Aeroflot. Patriotic framing leads these outlets to relay the hackers’ dramatic assertions as fact, with little skepticism or independent corroboration. ([Українська правда](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/07/28/7523738/), [Ukrinform-EN](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/4019565-hackers-claim-they-destroyed-aeroflot-it-infrastructure.html))

- **Tech and aviation industry press (TechCrunch, Simple Flying)**: Reports zero-in on the technical compromise—servers wiped, terabytes of data stolen—and the ensuing mass flight cancellations across Russia. Tech-centric outlets may sensationalize the scale of the hack to capture readership, leaning heavily on the attackers’ own statements rather than verified forensic details.
