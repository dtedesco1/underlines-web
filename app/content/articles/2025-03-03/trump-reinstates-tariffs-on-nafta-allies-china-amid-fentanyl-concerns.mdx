# Trump Reinstates Tariffs on NAFTA Allies & China Amid Fentanyl Concerns

On February 27, 2025, Trump confirmed that 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, paused since February 3, will resume on March 4, along with an extra 10% tariff on Chinese goods.

#### Focusing Facts

- 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports resume on March 4 after a one-month pause.

- China faces an additional 10% tariff on top of its existing 10%, effectively raising rates for many goods.

- Reciprocal tariffs on other major trading partners are scheduled to take effect on April 2.

#### Context

This tariff escalation harks back to previous trade tensions seen during the 2018-2020 U.S.-China trade war, but uniquely ties economic measures to domestic drug control, alleging that illicit drugs like fentanyl are entering via Canada and Mexico. Historically, tariff-based coercion, such as the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff, has had mixed long-term effects by triggering retaliatory measures that disrupt global trade systems. Over the past 100 years, trade policies as economic tools have continuously tested international alliances and market stability, and while this move signals a tougher stance on border security and drug flows, its broader implications could reshape North American trade dynamics and elevate global economic uncertainty for decades to come.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: They present Trump's tariff plans as a necessary measure to protect America from the influx of illicit drugs, framing the tariffs as a strong, decisive step toward enhancing national security. This camp tends to focus on border security and national sovereignty while downplaying the potential for negative economic impacts or political inconsistencies in the policy.

- **Liberal media**: They critique the tariffs as economically harmful and politically inconsistent, arguing that the proposed measures could trigger inflation and hurt working families. This perspective emphasizes the negative repercussions on consumers and the economy while sometimes overlooking the administration's stated security concerns.
