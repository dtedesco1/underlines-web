# Mumbai Court Orders FIR Against Ex-SEBI Chief Over 1994 Listing Fraud

On March 2, a Mumbai special court ordered an investigation into alleged listing irregularities dating back to 1994, involving former SEBI chairwoman Madhabi Puri Buch and five officials, prompting a stern legal rebuttal by the regulator.

#### Focusing Facts

- The court directed the registration of an FIR against Buch and five others for allegedly approving a faulty listing of Cals Refineries Ltd in 1994.

- Buch, the first woman to head SEBI, concluded her vigorous three-year tenure on February 28, 2025, marked by sweeping market reforms including the T+1 settlement transition.

- Her final day saw controversial promotions—15 GMs and her Executive Assistant elevated—triggering internal protests amid mounting regulatory critiques.

#### Context

This development echoes historical moments when financial regulators faced dual pressures of modernizing markets while grappling with legacy issues. Comparable to post-1929 reforms and the Sarbanes-Oxley era following early 2000s accounting scandals, Buch’s tenure was driven by rapid policy innovations and data-driven interventions designed to enhance market efficiency. However, the sudden judicial probe into a 1994 incident highlights how past procedural lapses can resurface during periods of institutional transformation. Over a hundred-year horizon, such episodes exemplify the persistent tension between the need for swift regulatory modernization and the long-term demands for accountability and transparency.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business and Reform-Focused Media**: They portray Buch as a transformative reformer whose aggressive improvements and data-driven strategies distinguished her tenure and strengthened market integrity. This group tends to focus on policy achievements and economic progress, potentially downplaying controversies or internal dissent to highlight reform success.

- **Investigative and Critical Media**: They emphasize allegations of regulatory oversight failures, listing irregularities, and internal dissent, depicting Buch’s tenure as marred by controversy and alleged misconduct. These outlets may focus selectively on negative incidents and legal probes, potentially amplifying sensational aspects and adverse implications.

- **SEBI Official Narrative and Defensive Reporting**: They present the regulatory body’s stance by challenging the FIR orders and dismissing the allegations as based on frivolous or habitual litigants, defending their procedural record. This perspective is likely to downplay the severity of the allegations and focus on legal technicalities in order to protect the institution’s reputation.
