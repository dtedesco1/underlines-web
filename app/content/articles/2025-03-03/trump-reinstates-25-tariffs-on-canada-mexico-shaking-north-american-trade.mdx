# Trump Reinstates 25% Tariffs on Canada & Mexico, Shaking North American Trade

On March 4, President Trump moved forward with reimposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, reversing a brief pause and deepening trade tensions while targeting border security and drug control issues.

#### Focusing Facts

- Tariffs cover over $900 billion in annual imports from Canada and Mexico.

- Auto sales could drop by approximately 13.6% in Canada and 10.6% in the U.S., with supply chains disrupted across the integrated North American auto industry.

- Additional duties include a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and increased tariffs on steel and aluminum, compounding logistical challenges.

#### Context

This event echoes past protectionist measures like the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, though now set against a backdrop of integrated supply chains and modern geopolitical disputes. The reinstatement of tariffs signals a pivot to aggressive neo-mercantilismâ€”a return to using trade policy as both a tool for national security and economic leverage. Over a century after major tariff wars altered global trade dynamics, Trump's policy choices may reshape North American manufacturing and consumer prices, setting long-term trends that challenge decades-long free trade paradigms.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: They argue that Trump's tariffs are a firm, America-first measure that supports domestic industries and sends a strong message to trading partners. This perspective tends to overlook the potential economic fallout and rising consumer costs in favor of nationalist rhetoric and political loyalty.

- **Economist and centrist critics**: They contend that the tariffs risk triggering inflation, supply chain disruptions, and economic uncertainty that can ultimately harm both consumers and industries. This view may emphasize economic risks over potential strategic gains, reflecting a reliance on established economic orthodoxies and sensitivity to market impacts.
