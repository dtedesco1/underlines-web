# Firefly’s Blue Ghost Achieves Historic Soft Landing on the Moon

On March 2, 2025, Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lander successfully touched down at Mare Crisium on the Moon’s near side, making it the second private spacecraft to achieve a soft landing.

#### Focusing Facts

- Blue Ghost landed at approximately 3:34 a.m. ET after a 45-day, 2.8-million-mile journey.

- It is the second private mission to reach the Moon and the first to land upright, achieving a touchdown within a 100-meter target zone.

- The lander, launched mid-January aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carried 10 scientific experiments for NASA under a $2.6bn Commercial Lunar Payload Services partnership.

#### Context

Blue Ghost’s landing echoes transformative moments in space history, reminiscent of the Apollo era’s brief yet groundbreaking lunar visits between 1969 and 1972. However, unlike the government-funded missions of the past, this mission is driven by commercial innovation and public-private partnerships, reflecting a long-term trend toward cost-effective space exploration. Over the next century, such advances could revolutionize lunar operations—just as the commercial aviation boom post-World War II reshaped travel—making sustainable lunar presence a routine aspect of humanity’s expansion into the solar system.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US Business and Conservative Media**: They celebrate the private company’s moon landing as a landmark success in commercial space innovation and a symbol of American capability.
