# IAEA Inspectors Enter Zaporizhzhia via Russian Route Amid Delayed Passage

On March 1, 2025, a fresh IAEA observer team arrived at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant through Russian territory after a nearly month-long delay amid mutual accusations between Russia and Ukraine.

#### Focusing Facts

- The 27th IAEA rotation, consisting of three inspectors, was allowed entry strictly via Russian-controlled routes.

- Delays of nearly a month were attributed to ongoing military activities and conflicting claims over safety protocol breaches by both sides.

- Russian official Yuri Chernichuk highlighted that this was the first transit through Russian territory for IAEA inspectors at the facility.

#### Context

This incident exemplifies the dangerous intersection of military conflict and nuclear safety, reminiscent of past episodes like the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which underscored the catastrophic risks when political and security imperatives override technical safeguards. Across the 20th and 21st centuries, as nuclear technology expanded amid geopolitical tussles—from Cold War rivalries to modern territorial disputes—ensuring the safety of nuclear sites has remained a pressing challenge. The delayed entry and contentious routes not only reflect the enduring vulnerability of key infrastructure in conflict zones, but also signal broader shifts where international oversight mechanisms must navigate contested sovereignty. In a 100-year perspective, such moments matter for setting precedents in how global institutions manage nuclear risks in war-torn regions, potentially influencing future norms in conflict resolution and the safeguarding of critical energy assets.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Nuclear Safety Advocates and Risk-Focused Media**: This group emphasizes the grave nuclear risks posed by conflict, highlighting repeated violations near nuclear sites and potentiating catastrophic consequences if military actions continue unchecked. Their narrative may use emotive language to stress imminent disaster, sometimes overplaying the dangers to advocate for de-escalation and stricter international oversight.

- **Official Reporting and IAEA Oversight Coverage**: This group focuses on straightforward reporting of IAEA monitoring missions and the procedural aspects of nuclear facility oversight, quoting official statements and detailing technical aspects of site access. They tend to rely on state-reported information and official narratives, which can downplay underlying risks by framing the situation as routine despite ongoing tensions.
