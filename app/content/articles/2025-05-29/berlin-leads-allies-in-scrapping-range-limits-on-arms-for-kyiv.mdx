# Berlin Leads Allies in Scrapping Range Limits on Arms for Kyiv

Between 26-28 May 2025, new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared — and the US, UK and France confirmed — that all Western-supplied weapons to Ukraine may now be used without geographic limits, authorising strikes on Russian soil.

#### Focusing Facts

- Merz’s 26 May 2025 WDR Europaforum speech stated “no longer any range restrictions… not from the Brits, the French, us or the Americans.”

- On 28 May 2025 Germany and Ukraine signed a defence-minister MoU to co-produce long-range missiles, potentially including the 500 km-range Taurus system.

- Russia’s 25 May 2025 raid of 298 drones and 69 missiles — the war’s largest — preceded the policy shift by one day.

#### Context

Major powers rarely tear up self-imposed ‘range rules’.  In March 1941 the U.S. Lend-Lease Act similarly removed distance constraints for British operations against Germany, widening WW II’s battlespace; in 1983 the Soviet decision to place SS-20s in Europe triggered NATO’s counter-deployment of Pershing-II, amplifying nuclear brinkmanship.  The 2025 decision reflects two structural trends: (1) Europe’s post-Cold-War taboo on enabling strikes inside Russia is eroding as Germany re-arms and seeks strategic autonomy amid fading U.S. appetite, and (2) proxy conflicts are increasingly fought with precision stand-off weapons whose political use restrictions prove temporary.  Whether this matters in 2125 depends on escalation control: if the move hastens diplomatic compromise, it will read like the 1918 lift of the naval blockade that shortened WW I; if it instead normalises cross-border bombardment between nuclear states, historians may mark it as the moment Europe stepped, eyes open, into another long spiral of deterrence and counter-deterrence.  Either way, it signals that Germany’s 80-year posture of military caution toward Moscow is loosening, a psychological threshold arguably as consequential as the missiles’ added kilometres.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning Western media**: They celebrate Germany and its allies lifting range limits as a necessary step that empowers Ukraine to strike Russian military targets and defend European democracy. Their coverage highlights Ukraine’s defensive needs while playing down Moscow’s warnings about nuclear escalation or possible diplomatic fallout. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/26/germany-and-ukraines-other-allies-scrap-range-limits-on-arms-sent-to-kyiv), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/world/europe/zelensky-merz-berlin-visit.html))

- **Public broadcasters highlighting escalation risks**: They report the policy change but foreground Kyiv’s new ability to hit deep inside Russia and the Kremlin’s warning that the move is “quite dangerous” for peace talks. In striving for balanced tone they may amplify Russian cautions and present the shift as a major provocation, potentially understating Ukraine’s rationale for long-range strikes. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw7vllepx7o), [Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/27/us-europe-lift-range-restrictions-on-ukraine-missiles-why-it-matters))

- **Russian state owned media**: They brand Berlin’s pledge as a provocative action that obstructs ongoing peace efforts and drags Germany deeper into the war. The narrative mirrors the Kremlin line, painting Western aid as the sole obstacle to peace while ignoring Russia’s own missile barrages and battlefield escalations.
