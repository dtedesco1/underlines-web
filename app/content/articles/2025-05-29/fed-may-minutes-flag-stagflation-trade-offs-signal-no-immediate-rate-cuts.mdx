# Fed May Minutes Flag Stagflation Trade-Offs, Signal No Immediate Rate Cuts

Minutes released 28 May 2025 show the May 6-7 FOMC unanimously kept rates at 4.25-4.50 % but warned tariffs could push inflation up and employment down, so the Fed will stay sidelined until the economic fallout is clearer.

#### Focusing Facts

- Fed staff told policymakers unemployment would breach its long-run natural-rate estimate by late 2025 and remain elevated through 2027 while inflation climbs.

- President Trump’s threatened 145 % tariff on Chinese imports was deferred after the meeting to no earlier than July, leaving policy uncertainty central to the Fed’s stance.

- Policymakers’ March median still pencilled in two quarter-point cuts by end-2025, but futures markets now price at most one cut.

#### Context

Central banks have confronted growth-inflation conflicts before—most famously the 1973-75 oil-price shock that doubled U.S. CPI while unemployment hit 9 % by 1975, forcing the Fed into a stop-go cycle that damaged its credibility until Volcker’s 1979 tightening.  The new minutes hint at a similar supply-shock dilemma, this time driven by strategic tariffs rather than oil, and occurring after a decade-long experiment with ultra-easy money and pandemic-era fiscal blowouts.  Long-term, this episode illustrates two structural trends: (1) the re-politicization of trade and its ability to transmit inflation even in a services-heavy economy, and (2) the shrinking policy space for central banks as debt-to-GDP ratios and neutral rates drift higher.  Whether or not a recession materialises in 2026, the credibility test for an independent Fed confronting inflationary supply shocks while Congress adds deficits will echo for decades; failure could tilt the century’s monetary regime toward permanently higher inflation expectations—something that took nearly 20 years to reverse after the 1970s.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Mainstream national economic news outlets (e.g., Reuters, The New York Times)**: They depict the Fed as prudently holding fire on further rate moves until it can gauge how Trump’s volatile tariff policy will affect growth and inflation, stressing officials’ consensus on a data-dependent, wait-and-see stance. Coverage foregrounds the drag from Trump’s trade agenda and frames the Fed’s caution as a sensible reaction, reflecting a tendency to highlight policy risks under the current administration while downplaying arguments that rates might already be too low.

- **Market-reaction trading media (e.g., FXStreet, FXEmpire)**: They seize on the minutes’ mention of simultaneous inflation and jobless risks to warn of looming stagflation, linking the headlines directly to short-term moves in gold prices, the dollar index and EUR/USD. Pieces are geared toward active traders, so language can be hyper-reactive and exaggerate immediate market impacts to drive clicks and trading engagement.

- **Skeptical/libertarian-leaning financial commentary sites (e.g., Zero Hedge, Forbes, Investing.com opinion)**: They argue the Fed is dithering—either having already cut too aggressively or now delaying needed hikes—framing the ‘wait-and-see’ posture as evidence the central bank has boxed itself in and left markets vulnerable. These outlets often distrust central-bank activism and favor hard-money views, so they spotlight Fed missteps and policy impotence while underemphasizing the complexities officials face.
