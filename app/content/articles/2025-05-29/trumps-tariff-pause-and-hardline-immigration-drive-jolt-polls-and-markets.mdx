# Trump's Tariff Pause and Hardline Immigration Drive Jolt Polls and Markets

In late May 2025, President Trump postponed a 50 % EU tariff by 38 days while doubling down on aggressive immigration enforcement—moves that coincided with a jump in U.S. media trust metrics and a relief rally across Asian bourses.

#### Focusing Facts

- Caliber survey (Apr 30–May 11, n=1,126) found trust in newspapers up to 17 % (from 14 % in Aug 2024) and TV news up to 16 % (from 12 %).

- Harvard/Harris poll released May 28 shows 78 % of voters back deporting criminal undocumented immigrants and 70 % support “closing the border,” giving Trump his strongest issue approval.

- Trump shifted the start date of a 50 % tariff on EU imports from Jun 1 to Jul 9, spurring the PSEi (+0.64 %) and MSCI Asia ex-Japan (+0.3 %) on May 28.

#### Context

The linkage between an adversarial White House, rising trust in the press, and market relief echoes Richard Nixon’s 1971 wage-price controls and subsequent “Nixon Shock,” when policy surprise briefly buoyed equities even as it hardened partisan media lines.  A half-century later, Trump’s tariff feints recreate that calculus: weaponize trade for leverage but yank the trigger to soothe investors.  Simultaneously, the electorate’s overwhelming support for harsh immigration policing mirrors the public mood that enabled the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform Act—suggesting cyclical hardening during economic unease.  On a 100-year arc, such oscillations show how U.S. politics alternates between nativist surges and liberalizing backswings; today’s mix of revived media skepticism, populist border rhetoric, and tariff brinkmanship may prove a temporary crest or the start of a longer nationalist phase, depending on whether economic gains materialize before voter fatigue sets in.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right-leaning U.S. conservative media (e.g., National Review)**: Portrays President Trump’s hard-line immigration enforcement as his clearest policy success, widely approved by voters according to new polling. Frames deportations and border crack-downs as overwhelmingly popular while playing down legal pushback and public worries about due-process, reflecting an incentive to defend the administration’s agenda.

- **Mainstream / center-left U.S. national media (e.g., Newsweek)**: Highlights a rebound in public trust toward newspapers and TV since Trump’s return, linking it to the press’s revived adversarial stance against the White House. By stressing modest percentage-point gains in trust, it underscores the media’s watchdog value and may overstate the broader public’s confidence levels, which remain historically low.

- **International business press focusing on markets (The Jakarta Post, Philippine Daily Inquirer)**: Sees Trump’s decision to delay new tariffs and signs of easing U.S.–EU trade frictions as a catalyst for global stock rallies, treating the move as positive for investors. Prioritises short-term market optimism and ignores the longer-term unpredictability of Trump’s trade policy, reflecting a market-centric lens rather than a critical policy assessment.
