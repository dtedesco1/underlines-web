# Samsung Eyes Perplexity as Default AI Partner for Galaxy S26, Signaling Break from Google

Samsung is close to a deal to preload Perplexity’s AI search and assistant on all Galaxy S26 phones in early 2026 and will back the startup’s new $500 million round, a concrete move to lessen dependence on Google Gemini.

#### Focusing Facts

- Proposed terms make Perplexity the default assistant on the Galaxy S26 line launching H1 2026, with its app and search hard-wired into Samsung Internet.

- Samsung intends to invest in Perplexity’s $500 million raise that values the Jeff-Bezos–backed firm at roughly $14 billion.

- Negotiations include co-developing an AI-infused operating system and folding Perplexity tech into Bixby.

#### Context

When Samsung flirted with its own Tizen OS for the Galaxy Gear in 2013 and even shipped Tizen phones in 2015, the goal was the same: reduce strategic dependence on Google’s Android stack. Those efforts fizzled, but every decade the hardware giant re-tests the moat. This Perplexity pact echoes IBM’s 1981 decision to license, rather than own, MS-DOS—outsourcing a critical layer can create lock-in that later undercuts leverage. AI assistants are today’s operating systems: whoever owns the interaction funnel owns the data and monetisation. The deal reflects a larger trend of device makers (Apple with ChatGPT, Huawei with Pangu) hedging their AI supply chain to avoid single-vendor capture just as regulators intensify scrutiny of Google’s 90% search share. Over a 100-year horizon the move itself may be a footnote, but it illuminates the continuous pendulum swing between vertical integration and multi-sourcing that defines tech platform power—and suggests the post-search era will be fought on handsets, not browsers.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Business and tech-oriented financial outlets (e.g., Economic Times, Wccftech)**: Frame the prospective Samsung–Perplexity tie-up as a strategic win-win that will broaden Samsung’s AI arsenal and give Perplexity huge scale while loosening Google’s grip. Tend to amplify growth narratives fed by company insiders because upbeat deal coverage attracts readers and advertisers and relies heavily on unnamed sources close to the talks.

- **Telecom industry trade press (e.g., Telecoms.com)**: Dismiss the integration as another hype-driven gimmick that won’t really differentiate Samsung phones in a market where AI tools are already ubiquitous. Takes a contrarian stance that pokes holes in handset makers’ claims, partly to serve its core readership of operators who compete with device vendors and to generate traffic through skepticism.

- **Indian mainstream news outlets focusing on antitrust angles (e.g., The Indian Express, Analytics India Magazine)**: Portray the move as Samsung’s bid to cut financial dependence on Google after revelations that Google pays the company heavily for Gemini default placement, situating the deal within broader antitrust scrutiny of Google’s search monopoly. Highlighting regulatory tension with Google resonates with domestic tech policy debates and can overstate the immediacy of any breakup to spotlight local competitive concerns.
