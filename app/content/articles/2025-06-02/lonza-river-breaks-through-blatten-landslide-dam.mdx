# Lonza River Breaks Through Blatten Landslide Dam

On 30 May 2025 the previously blocked Lonza River cut a channel through six million cubic metres of glacier debris, lowering the new lake behind the dam by roughly one metre and easing immediate flood danger to evacuated Alpine villages.

#### Focusing Facts

- Birch Glacier’s collapse on 28 May 2025 dumped ≈6 million m³ of rock plus 3 million m³ of ice, burying 90 % of Blatten and displacing 300 residents.

- Ferden hydro-dam gates were partially opened on the evening of 30 May to modulate downstream flow while authorities kept evacuation orders in place.

- One 64-year-old resident remains missing amid debris that in places exceeds 100 m in height.

#### Context

Sudden lake-outburst threats in the Alps recall the 1818 Giétro Glacier disaster, when a natural ice dam burst and killed 44 in Valais, and the 1966 Vajont slide that overtopped an Italian dam; both showed how fast geomorphic dams can fail.  The Blatten event stems from longer trends: accelerated permafrost thaw and glacier retreat destabilise high Alpine slopes, while hydropower infrastructure and dense tourism settlements crowd narrow valleys, magnifying consequences.  Switzerland’s quick evacuations, drone surveys and controlled dam releases demonstrate lessons learned over two centuries of mountain hazard management, yet the episode hints at a future where such “rare” collapses become routine.  Fifty or a hundred years hence, the question may be less about rebuilding Blatten than about whether permanent habitation in rapidly warming high valleys remains viable at all.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US and Canadian outlets running the AP wire (e.g., Winnipeg Sun, Hartford Courant, Castanet, Washington Examiner, The Independent)**: Report that the Lonza River has resumed flowing through the debris and water levels are dropping, framing the situation mainly as a reassuring sign that the immediate flood danger is subsiding. Because they lean heavily on the same Associated Press copy, they largely echo official reassurances and give little space to underlying causes such as climate change or longer-term hazards, potentially giving readers a prematurely optimistic picture.

- **UK tabloid Daily Mail Online**: Portrays Blatten as almost completely ‘wiped out,’ highlighting dramatic satellite imagery, the lone missing resident, and explicitly raises the possibility that climate change contributed to the glacier collapse. The tabloid’s commercial incentive for eye-catching headlines drives a sensational tone that may overstate devastation and speculate on climate links without the nuanced caveats experts give, keeping readers in a heightened state of alarm.

- **Swiss specialised outlet SWI swissinfo.ch**: Focuses on granular geological data—debris cone size, potential hidden water pockets, simulations of dam capacity—and conveys officials’ guarded confidence while detailing multiple remaining risks that could still force evacuations. Its proximity to Swiss authorities and reliance on cantonal hazard officials for information can tilt coverage toward the government’s technical framing and mitigation narrative, downplaying blame or broader environmental critiques.
