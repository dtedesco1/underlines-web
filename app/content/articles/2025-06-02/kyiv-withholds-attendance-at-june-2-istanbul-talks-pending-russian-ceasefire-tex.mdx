# Kyiv Withholds Attendance at June 2 Istanbul Talks Pending Russian Ceasefire Text

On 30 May–1 June, Ukraine said it will not send a delegation to the June 2 Istanbul negotiations until Moscow delivers a written ceasefire memorandum, while simultaneously striking Russian air bases with drones.

#### Focusing Facts

- Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha (30 May) stated Kyiv has received “no document” from Russia and therefore has not confirmed participation in the 2 June talks.

- Ukraine’s 1 June drone raid destroyed about 41 Russian strategic aircraft at four bases, Russia admitting attacks on five airfields.

- Turkey proposes a later summit bringing Presidents Trump, Putin and Zelensky together if the Istanbul round shows progress.

#### Context

Great-power mediated ceasefire talks that stall over basic agenda-setting recall the 1968 Paris peace talks, where North Vietnam and the U.S. haggled for weeks merely over the shape of the negotiating table—a reminder that procedural deadlock often masks substantive gulf. This episode fits two larger arcs: (1) the diffusion of long-range precision strike by small states—Ukraine’s deep-penetration drone raid mirrors Israel’s 1981 strike on Iraq’s Osirak reactor, showing how technology lets a weaker actor set the tempo; (2) the slow breakdown of the post-Cold-War European security order, as both sides now openly debate NATO expansion limits once thought settled. Whether the Istanbul meeting happens matters because negotiated endings, if they come at all, tend to crystallize when battlefield momentum, outside pressure, and clear written offers converge. If that convergence fails, the war could echo the Korean conflict—an unresolved armistice that freezes lines for decades. On a century scale, the tussle over documents versus drones illustrates a broader shift: power is now exercised as much through information control and unmanned systems as through traditional massed armies, suggesting future wars and peaces will be negotiated under the shadow of instant, remote, asymmetric strikes.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western liberal or centrist outlets (e.g., BBC, The Guardian, The Independent, Reuters)**: They present Russia as stone-walling the Istanbul talks while Ukraine seeks genuine terms and international backing for a ceasefire. By foregrounding Russian duplicity and highlighting Zelensky’s demands, the coverage bolsters Western governments’ pro-Kyiv stance and can downplay any Ukrainian reluctance or battlefield escalation. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/31/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-accuses-moscow-of-doing-everything-it-can-to-sabotage-peace-talks), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93yv5zpk1ko))

- **Russian state-owned media (RT)**: It claims Zelensky is deliberately delaying negotiations to cling to power and prolong the war, insisting Moscow is ready for meaningful talks. The narrative absolves the Kremlin of responsibility, portrays Ukraine as the obstacle, and echoes official Russian talking points meant to justify continued military operations.

- **Right-leaning U.S. tabloid media (e.g., New York Post)**: Coverage centres on Trump’s mediation efforts, faults Kyiv for acting unilaterally with deep-strike drones, and suggests Zelensky shares blame for the war’s continuation. The framing elevates Trump’s role, shifts some culpability away from Moscow, and mirrors U.S. partisan incentives by scrutinising an ally viewed skeptically by conservative audiences.
