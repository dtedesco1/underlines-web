# Perplexity AI Revises TikTok Merger Proposal with Potential 50% US Government Stake

Perplexity AI submitted a revised merger proposal with TikTok US, potentially offering the US government a 50% stake once the entity goes public, absent voting rights or board seats.

#### Focusing Facts

- The proposal suggests a public offering of NewCo, valuing it at $300 billion, following a merger with TikTok US.

- The revised plan accommodates feedback from the Trump administration, aligning with US laws to reduce Chinese ownership.

- The US government shares would lack voting power or board representation.

#### Context

The Perplexity AI proposal is reminiscent of Cold War-era corporate strategies where national security was often cited to limit foreign ownership in critical industries. In the 1980s, for example, Japan faced similar US scrutiny over its acquisition of American semiconductor companies. This proposal reflects ongoing trends of economic nationalism and protectionism re-emerging in recent years, especially in tech sectors seen as strategically vital. This moment is significant on a 100-year scale as it exemplifies the intersection of technological power and national interests, a theme likely to persist as nations navigate digital sovereignty and cybersecurity concerns. The engagement of government stakes in private enterprises also signals a shift in public-private collaborations amid global tech competition.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **US mainstream media**: They see the revised proposal by Perplexity AI to merge with TikTok as a strategic move to give the US government a substantial stake in TikTok while addressing American national security concerns. They may emphasize US control and security concerns to align with domestic regulatory pressures while downplaying China's potential influence through ByteDance.

- **Indian media**: They highlight the involvement of Indian-origin founder of Perplexity AI, focusing on the potential benefits of the merger while underscoring the controversies like plagiarism accusations and competition with giants like Google and OpenAI. They might focus more on the entrepreneurial success and global influence of an Indian-origin founder, which can overshadow critical aspects of the proposal's implications for Chinese ownership of TikTok.

- **Right-leaning media**: They portray the proposal as a beneficial deal for the US, emphasizing Trump's involvement and potential beneficial outcomes for US interests. They could potentially overstate benefits to downplay concerns related to government ownership stakes, feeding into narratives of strong nationalist policy-making.
