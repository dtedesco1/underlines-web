# Astronomers Mistake SpaceX's Tesla Roadster for Asteroid 2018 CN41

In January 2025, astronomers mistakenly identified Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster, launched in 2018, as a near-Earth asteroid before retracting the classification.

#### Focusing Facts

- The object was misidentified as asteroid 2018 CN41 on January 2, 2025, and the error was corrected within 17 hours.

- The Tesla Roadster was launched on February 6, 2018, as part of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket maiden flight.

- The error highlighted issues with the tracking of artificial objects in space.

#### Context

This event echoes historical incidences where technology and hubris intersect, reminiscent of the 'Great Moon Hoax' in 1835 when newspapers falsely claimed discoveries of life on the moon. Such mistaken identities underscore persistent issues in space governance and the challenge of tracking the ever-growing number of artificial objects. The proliferation of space debris has become a concern, mirroring growing anxieties about environmental management on Earth. Over a century, this could catalyze international regulatory frameworks for space activities similar to Earth-based environmental treaties. As commercial activities in space expand, the management of space junk is not merely a logistical challenge but also a moral imperative, reflecting our responsibility towards sustainable practices beyond our terrestrial confines.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Right leaning media**: The registration error of the Tesla Roadster as an asteroid reveals challenges in accurately tracking space objects, and showcases Elon Musk's impactful ventures in space technology. This perspective might downplay the oversight as an 'innovation hiccup' and avoid criticizing Musk heavily, given his significant contributions to technology and business that align with capitalist success narratives.

- **Mainstream media**: The misidentification of Musk's Tesla Roadster stresses the need for better tracking mechanisms to distinguish artificial objects and potential asteroids, raising concerns about space safety and governance. This stance may amplify issues of space governance and regulatory oversight, presenting them as urgent matters that require international cooperation and institutional intervention.

- **Tech-centered media**: The Tesla Roadster incident highlights both the whimsical aspects of space exploration and the concrete issues related to tracking space debris effectively. This angle might glorify Elon Musk and SpaceX's achievements without fully addressing the environmental and regulatory responsibilities entailed in their operations, focusing instead on the awe of technological feats.
