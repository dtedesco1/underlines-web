# DeepSeek's R1 AI Model Capsizes Global Tech Markets

DeepSeek's low-cost R1 AI model, developed at under $6 million, triggered a slump in global tech stocks, notably US giants like Nvidia, and sparked debate over AI development costs and methods.

#### Focusing Facts

- DeepSeek's model reportedly cost $5.6 million to train compared to the $100 million to $1 billion range stated by competitors.

- Shares of Nvidia plummeted by 13.6% following DeepSeek's app ascension to the top of Apple's App Store.

- DeepSeek faced a major cyber-attack that temporarily limited app registrations while maintaining existing user access.

#### Context

The rise of DeepSeek's V3 model echoes the Soviet Union's 1957 'Sputnik moment' that challenged US technological supremacy. Historically, constraints have often driven innovation, as seen in the spurt of dot-com startups during the late 1990s when resources were limited. DeepSeek's approach - low capital use and open-source models - challenges the entrenched belief that greater financial and computational resources equate to better AI. This moment highlights the long-term trend of resource-efficient technology development disrupting established industries. On a centennial scale, DeepSeek's ascent could represent a pivot point where financial leverage becomes less crucial than innovative efficiency, potentially reshaping global tech market dynamics and pushing Western firms towards leaner and more inclusive technological competition.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Western business media**: DeepSeek represents a major threat to US tech companies due to its ability to deliver advanced AI models at a fraction of the usual cost. This perspective highlights the cost efficiency to stress the challenge to Western economic interests, potentially amplifying fears to encourage protective measures or market adjustments.

- **Chinese tech media**: DeepSeek showcases the potential of Chinese innovation, highlighting the nation's ability to compete with limited resources and circumvent US tech restrictions. This narrative emphasizes China's technological success, potentially downplaying the impact of trade restrictions and promoting a sense of national pride and achievement.
