# Trump and Putin Signal Readiness for Broad Negotiations Beyond Ukraine

Trump and Putin express willingness to negotiate on Ukraine and broader U.S.-Russia relations, signaling potential arms control talks and strategic alignments.

#### Focusing Facts

- Putin praises Trump and expresses readiness for talks on Jan. 24, 2025.

- Trump threatens high tariffs and sanctions on Russia amid talks of peace deal.

- Talks could affect the expiration of the New START treaty in February 2026.

#### Context

The potential negotiations between Trump and Putin echo historic Cold War-era arms control talks, such as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) signed in 1991. The current discussions appear to pivot on broader U.S.-Russia relations, reminiscent of the shifts following Nixon's 1972 visit to China, which reoriented global political dynamics. More than a mere diplomatic tete-a-tete, this moment is pivotal, not just for alleviating immediate military tensions but for setting a precedent in nuclear arms race discourse. However, skepticism remains high given past ebbs and flows of U.S.-Russia diplomacy, and the possibility that Russia seeks to use these talks as a geopolitical tool. On a century-long scale, the outcome could mark a defining turn in nuclear de-escalation or a re-ignition of competitive posturing akin to Cold War doctrines.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Left leaning media**: The ongoing discussions between Trump and Putin are viewed with skepticism, emphasizing concerns about manipulation and potential ulterior motives by Putin to isolate Ukraine from peace negotiations. There is a tendency to highlight Trump's willingness to engage with Putin as indicative of potential susceptibility to Russian influence, possibly exacerbated by Trump's controversial past dealings with Russia.

- **Right leaning media**: Trump is portrayed as a strong leader capable of ending the Ukraine conflict by pressuring Putin through economic means while emphasizing strategic negotiations. This narrative often overlooks Trump's criticisms of Ukraine's leadership and frames his approach as pragmatic without acknowledging the complexities of international diplomacy involved.

- **Pro-Ukrainian and European perspectives**: There is cautious optimism about Trump's understanding of the stakes in Ukraine, but also concerns about his unpredictability and potential erosion of pro-Ukraine alliances. While there is a hopeful outlook on some aspects of Trump's policy, there remains skepticism about his commitment to democracy and Ukraine's sovereignty, fearing rushed or superficial solutions.
