# DeepSeek's AI Model Outperforms US Competitors, Challenges Dominance

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek released a high-performing, low-cost AI model that outperforms top US models, causing alarm in Silicon Valley.

#### Focusing Facts

- DeepSeek's model was built in two months for under $6 million.

- It outperformed models from Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic on benchmark tests.

- DeepSeek-R1 also surpassed OpenAI o1, released on January 20, 2025.

#### Context

This event echoes the historic tech competition akin to the 1980s Japan-USA rivalry in electronics, reflecting a shift in technological supremacy. The trend of AI's evolution towards open-source and cost-efficient development marks a paradigm shift away from the resource-intensive model dominated by companies in the US. Over a century-long timescale, this could signal a realignment of global tech leadership, challenging the longstanding narrative of US technological and innovative supremacy. The rapid advancement of DeepSeek and its implications for AI underscores essential questions regarding the balance of power in tech innovation and the future direction of AI ethics and policy.
