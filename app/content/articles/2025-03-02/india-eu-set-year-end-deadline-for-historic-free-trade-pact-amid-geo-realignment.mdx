# India-EU Set Year-End Deadline for Historic Free Trade Pact Amid Geo-Realignments

In early March 2025, during an unprecedented visit by the EU Commission to India, both leaders committed to finalizing a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement by year-end, signaling a major pivot in global economic and strategic alliances.

#### Focusing Facts

- FTA negotiations, resumed in 2022 after a failed 2007 attempt, now target completion by December 2025.

- Key dialogues involved PM Modi and EU Commission President von der Leyen, focusing on trade, technology, green energy, security, and defence partnerships.

- Bilateral trade figures reached $137.41 billion in goods (2023-24), with discussions also targeting tariff reforms across various sectors.

#### Context

This renewed push for an India-EU trade pact recalls transformative moments such as the 1992 Single Market formation in the EU, which redefined economic integration in post-Cold War Europe. Like then, today's agreement is emerging within a context of shifting global alliancesâ€”addressing not only economic imperatives but also strategic challenges posed by the US, China, and evolving security landscapes. In a century-long view, this comprehensive FTA underscores the continuing evolution of international trade systems, where long-standing trends of economic integration, technological advancement, and geopolitical realignments converge to reshape global order.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Economic Trade Advocates**: They portray the India-EU pact as a pragmatic and transformative deal to boost trade, technology, and investment through a detailed blueprint for collaboration. This perspective tends to highlight economic benefits and strategic partnership while downplaying potential complexities or geopolitical challenges that might complicate the deal.

- **Geopolitical Urgency Narrators**: They frame the pact as a necessary response to escalating global geopolitical pressures, particularly underscored by US tariff threats and shifting power dynamics. This narrative may overemphasize the external geopolitical threats and cast the deal primarily as a countermeasure, potentially ignoring the economic nuances in favor of a reactive political stance.
