# Ceasefire in Crisis: Israel’s Non-Withdrawal from Gaza Border Sparks Renewed Negotiations

Despite a ceasefire in effect since January 19, Israel’s refusal to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor on February 27 is undermining the deal, prompting urgent second-phase talks in Cairo amid escalating hostage disputes and major arms sales.

#### Focusing Facts

- On February 27, Israeli officials declared they would not leave the Philadelphi Corridor, contrary to ceasefire terms, with satellite images confirming new military construction.

- Hamas indicated willingness to cede governance of Gaza to a unified Palestinian government if a separate, independent state is established, linking disarmament to political conditions.

- The Trump administration approved a nearly $3 billion arms sale to Israel, including over 35,500 advanced bombs, even as negotiations for ceasefire extension remain in flux.

#### Context

The current developments echo historical patterns of protracted Middle East conflicts, notably reminiscent of disputes during the Oslo Accords in the 1990s, where ambiguous border controls and renegotiation of terms repeatedly destabilized fragile truces. The refusal to withdraw from a strategically critical corridor, combined with high-stakes hostage exchanges and escalations in arms procurement, reflects long-term trends where security imperatives conflict with efforts at political reconciliation. This moment, unfolding in the aftermath of the devastating October 2023 attacks and a 15-month drag of intermittent fighting, could either herald a more entrenched conflict or spur a reimagining of ceasefire mechanics—a pattern that has haunted the region for nearly a century and continues to shape the socio-political landscape on a multi-generational scale.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Arab and Regional Media**: These sources emphasize the fragility of the ceasefire, arguing that Israel’s refusal to withdraw from key areas such as the Gaza-Egypt border is undermining further negotiations and endangering civilian lives. They may portray Israel’s security measures as aggressive stalling while largely highlighting Hamas’ willingness to negotiate, potentially downplaying legitimate Israeli security concerns.

- **Pro-Israel Conservative Media**: These outlets stress the urgent need to secure Israeli lives and emphasize the terror and intransigence of Hamas, framing ceasefire disputes and arms deals as measures to safeguard a beleaguered nation. Their narration may downplay the humanitarian impact on Palestinians and oversimplify complex negotiations, focusing instead on victimization and state security.

- **International Diplomatic and UN-aligned Media**: These sources call for strict adherence to the ceasefire and a renewed commitment to humanitarian aid and a long-term political framework based on international law and a two-State solution. They can be criticized for abstracting away from immediate on-ground realities and not fully addressing the tactical security concerns driving the conflict.
