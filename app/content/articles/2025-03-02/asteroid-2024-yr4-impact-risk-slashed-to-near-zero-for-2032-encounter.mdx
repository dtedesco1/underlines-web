# Asteroid 2024 YR4 Impact Risk Slashed to Near Zero for 2032 Encounter

New telescope data from ESO's VLT and collaborating observatories has reduced 2024 YR4's estimated collision risk for its December 2032 flyby from nearly 3% to less than 0.005%.

#### Focusing Facts

- Impact probability revised to 0.001%-0.004% from an initial 3% estimate.

- 2024 YR4 will safely pass Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, with a 1.7% chance of striking the Moon.

- Enhanced trajectory refinement was achieved using European Southern Observatory's VLT observations collected in February 2025.

#### Context

This update mirrors historical recalibrations in asteroid monitoring: similar to how the Chicxulub impact event 66 million years ago redefined our understanding of catastrophic space events, modern observations have refined early, uncertain predictions. The shift from a 3% risk to near zero underscores the dynamic nature of orbital prediction and the success of international efforts—such as NASA's 2022 DART mission—to improve planetary defense mechanisms. Over a century-long horizon, this event highlights how incremental improvements in observational technology can dramatically alter perceived threats, reminding us that systematic vigilance in tracking near-Earth objects is crucial in a long-term planetary safety framework.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Science and Space Agencies**: They report that the improved observational data has reduced the asteroid’s collision probability to nearly zero, emphasizing that established scientific methods and ongoing monitoring ensure Earth’s safety. Their perspective may lean on institutional assurances and could underplay lingering uncertainties to reassure the public.

- **Sensationalist/Speculative Opinion Media**: They spotlight early alarming estimates and worst-case scenarios to dramatize the asteroid’s potential impact, framing it as a major cataclysmic threat. This view tends to emphasize dramatic language and speculative consequences for higher reader engagement, potentially overstating the actual risk.
