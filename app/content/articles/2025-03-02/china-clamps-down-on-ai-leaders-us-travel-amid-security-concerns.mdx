# China Clamps Down on AI Leaders’ U.S. Travel Amid Security Concerns

On Feb 28, 2025, Beijing directed top AI entrepreneurs to avoid U.S. travel to protect sensitive advancements and mitigate geopolitical vulnerabilities.

#### Focusing Facts

- DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng declined a Paris AI summit invitation in February 2025.

- Chinese AI executives must report travel plans and debrief authorities on return.

- A major AI startup founder cancelled a planned U.S. trip in 2024 following Beijing’s instructions.

#### Context

This travel restriction recalls the earlier detention of a Huawei executive in Canada during the first Trump administration, illustrating a long-standing tactic of using high-profile tech figures as leverage in geopolitical disputes. Historically, similar measures have been seen in Cold War science controls where innovation was tightly monitored for national security. Over the next century, this move may reinforce a pattern of stricter controls over international tech collaboration, altering global competitive dynamics in artificial intelligence and broader strategic industries.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International Mainstream Media**: These outlets report that China’s directive for AI leaders to avoid U.S. travel is a security measure aimed at preventing sensitive information leaks and avoiding scenarios where executives could be used as diplomatic bargaining chips. Their reliance on official sources and established reporting may downplay China’s broader strategic or internal political motives, offering a more sanitized and governmental perspective.

- **Business and Travel Analysis**: This group frames the travel restrictions as not only a national security move but also as a potential hindrance to global tech collaboration and business mobility amid escalating U.S.-China tech competition. Their focus on the economic and collaborative fallout might exaggerate the isolationist trends and risks for international business, aligning with industry concerns rather than a broader geopolitical analysis.
