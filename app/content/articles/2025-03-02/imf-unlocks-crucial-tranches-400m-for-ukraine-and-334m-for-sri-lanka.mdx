# IMF Unlocks Crucial Tranches: $400M for Ukraine and $334M for Sri Lanka

In late February and early March 2025, the IMF advanced critical funding by approving a staff-level agreement for Ukraine's $400M tranche under its $15.5B EFF and releasing Sri Lanka's fourth tranche of $334M from its $2.9B bailout package.

#### Focusing Facts

- Ukraine’s EFF program reached a staff-level agreement after 8 days of negotiations, paving the way for $400M release pending board approval.

- Sri Lanka met key quantitative benchmarks in its 48-month Extended Fund Facility, enabling the release of its fourth tranche of $334M, raising total disbursements to about $1.3B.

- Ukraine has received over $12.4B in IMF support since the conflict escalated, while Sri Lanka secured its seventeenth IMF programme following its 2023 sovereign default.

#### Context

These funding disbursements echo historical episodes where the IMF played a pivotal role in economic stabilization, similar to interventions during the 1980s Latin American debt crises and the 2008 financial downturn. For Ukraine, with a legacy of continuous support amid conflict since 2014 and persistent structural challenges in an ongoing war, this tranche reinforces a reliance on targeted external aid to sustain reform efforts. In Sri Lanka, recovering from its first-ever sovereign default in 2023—a crisis that sparked widespread protests—this tranche is part of a long-term strategy to restore debt sustainability and economic resilience. On a 100-year trajectory, these decisions underscore the systemic role of multilateral financial interventions to manage sovereign vulnerabilities amid global economic shifts, highlighting both the cyclical nature of crises and the long-run transformations in international financial governance.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **International Financial Media**: These articles present the IMF’s staff-level agreement with Ukraine as a stabilizing financial milestone that underscores external support and progress in crucial economic reforms amid war uncertainties. This framing may understate the depth of Ukraine’s ongoing war hardships and internal challenges by focusing mainly on technical financial achievements.

- **South Asian Economic Media**: These articles portray the IMF bailout for Sri Lanka as a vital step towards economic recovery and debt sustainability after a severe crisis, marking successful reform efforts. This narrative might downplay continuing public discontent and the broader socioeconomic pains by emphasizing technical and reform-oriented achievements.
