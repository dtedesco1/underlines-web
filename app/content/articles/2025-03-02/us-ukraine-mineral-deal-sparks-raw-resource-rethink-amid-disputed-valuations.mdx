# US-Ukraine Mineral Deal Sparks Raw Resource Rethink Amid Disputed Valuations

On February 28, 2025, Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy are set to sign a framework agreement granting the US joint access to Ukraine’s contested critical mineral reserves in exchange for part of future revenues, while security guarantees remain vague.

#### Focusing Facts

- Trump’s initial demand for $500 billion in mineral revenues was dropped from the latest draft accord.

- Estimates show 40% of Ukraine’s critical minerals lie in Russian-occupied regions, complicating viable extraction.

- Ukraine holds roughly 5% of the world's critical raw materials, including significant deposits of graphite, lithium, and titanium.

#### Context

This deal echoes historic resource-driven strategies, such as the 19th-century U.S. expansion via the Guano Islands Act, where natural wealth justified territorial grabs. In today’s context, the scramble for strategic minerals—amplified by global supply chain vulnerabilities and China’s dominance in rare earth processing—reflects long-term geopolitical trends that intertwine economic aid with national security. However, with extraction projects likely taking a decade or more to materialize amidst infrastructural and territorial challenges, the impact of this deal on global strategic balances may be measured in generations rather than years.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Trump administration advocates and supportive US media**: They view the proposed deal for accessing Ukraine’s mineral wealth as a strategic tool to recoup U.S. aid, reduce dependency on rivals like China and Russia, and gain economic leverage in global supply chains. This perspective may downplay the significant uncertainties around extraction costs, outdated geological data, and long-term infrastructural challenges while emphasizing a nationalist, compensation-centred rationale.

- **Skeptical analysts and critical opinion writers**: They argue that Ukraine’s mineral wealth, while substantial on paper, is economically uncertain, logistically challenging to exploit, and risks echoing 19th-century resource grabs with questionable long-term benefits. This view may focus on the historical and ethical pitfalls of aggressive resource extraction and ignore potential strategic benefits, leaning towards a cautionary tone on imperialistic strategies.
