# Firefly's Blue Ghost Targets Historic Soft Lunar Landing

Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, orbiting the Moon since February 13, is set to attempt a soft landing in Mare Crisium on March 2, 2025, marking a pivotal milestone for commercial lunar missions.

#### Focusing Facts

- Launched on January 15, 2025, Blue Ghost entered lunar orbit on February 13, 2025.

- Carrying 10 NASA payloads under the CLPS program, the lander is preparing for a descent with a final 19-second burn at a 100-km perilune.

- It is positioned in a near-circular low lunar orbit at approximately 100 km altitude before its scheduled landing at around 3:45 a.m. EST.

#### Context

Blue Ghost's landing attempt is reminiscent of the ambitious Apollo era, notably since Apollo 17 in 1972 was the last successful intact American lunar landing. This mission, following Intuitive Machines' 2024 commercial touchdown, exemplifies the evolving role of private enterprise in space exploration. Similar to early aviation breakthroughs like the Wright brothersâ€™ 1903 flight that reshaped transportation, these lunar endeavors signal a long-term shift from government-dominated to commercially-driven space missions. Over the next century, this trend may fundamentally reshape how humanity accesses and utilizes space, blending legacy technologies with innovative commercial strategies.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Science and Technology Media**: These outlets emphasize Blue Ghost as a groundbreaking technical achievement in commercial lunar exploration, celebrating the precision and detailed engineering behind the mission. They may overstate the technological success and downplay the risks inherent in challenging lunar landings to foster a narrative of inevitable progress.
