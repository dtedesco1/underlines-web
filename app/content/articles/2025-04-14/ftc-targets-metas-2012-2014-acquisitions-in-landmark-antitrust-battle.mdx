# FTC Targets Meta’s 2012 & 2014 Acquisitions in Landmark Antitrust Battle

In a high-stakes trial that began on April 13-14, 2025, U.S. regulators accuse Meta of using its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to quash emerging competition.

#### Focusing Facts

- FTC cites internal emails, including one where Zuckerberg stated 'better to buy than to compete.'

- Divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp could follow if the court finds Meta abused its market power, jeopardizing over 50% of its U.S. ad revenue.

- Judge James Boasberg, who previously dismissed an earlier version in 2021, now presides over the revised case filed in December 2020.

#### Context

This trial mirrors historical antitrust battles like the 1911 breakup of Standard Oil and the 1982 AT&T divestiture, where government intervention reined in market dominance to foster fair competition. It reflects a long-term trend of regulatory efforts aiming to balance innovation with competitive markets, challenging deeply entrenched monopolistic practices. On a centennial scale, this case may reshape how digital markets are defined and regulated, potentially setting a precedent that affects not only Big Tech but also future strategies for innovation and consumer protection.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Regulatory and Antitrust-Focused Media**: These outlets portray the trial as an important effort by the FTC to address what they see as Meta’s anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition with its Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions. They may emphasize the potential harm to consumer choice and market fairness while downplaying Meta's claims of user benefit and innovation, aligning with a broader skepticism of Big Tech.

- **Pro-Meta Corporate Narrative**: This group defends Meta’s acquisitions by arguing that the deals enhanced user experience, spurred innovation and that the FTC’s case is based on a misinterpretation of market dynamics. The narrative is inclined to dismiss regulatory concerns and may understate the implications of monopolistic behavior in favor of protecting corporate interests and innovation incentives.
