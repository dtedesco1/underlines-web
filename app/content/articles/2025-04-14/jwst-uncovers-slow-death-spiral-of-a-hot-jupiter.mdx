# JWST Uncovers Slow Death Spiral of a Hot Jupiter

The James Webb Space Telescope’s recent infrared observations reveal that the demise of a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting star ZTF SLRN-2020 was due to a gradual orbital decay, not an abrupt red giant engulfment.

#### Focusing Facts

- The planet’s orbit, initially even closer than Mercury’s orbit around the Sun, shrank over millions of years until it began grazing the star’s outer layers.

- Observations using Webb’s MIRI and NIRSpec instruments identified a hot circumstellar disk with molecular gas—including carbon monoxide—around a sun-like star (70% of solar mass) located 12,000 light-years away.

- Initial infrared brightening detected by NEOWISE and an optical flash via the Zwicky Transient Facility in 2020 set the stage for reevaluating the planet’s fate.

#### Context

This discovery, echoing paradigm shifts like the revelations from SN 1987A in February 1987 which transformed our understanding of stellar explosions, underscores that planetary systems can evolve in unexpected, gradual ways. Instead of the once-assumed rapid consumption by a red giant, tidal forces slowly led to the planet’s demise—a mechanism hinted at since the first hot Jupiter discoveries in 1995. This event not only refines models of star-planet interactions but also prompts a broader reevaluation of long-term planetary system evolution, influencing how we view the distant future of systems like our own over the next 100 years and beyond.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **NASA & Scientific Outlets**: These articles (e.g., 8629401309, 8629491074, 2025-04-686835751) emphasize detailed technical analysis from the James Webb Space Telescope to outline that the planet’s demise resulted from a slow orbital decay rather than a red giant’s expansion. They may understate uncertainties and stress scientific consensus to reinforce institutional credibility, leaning towards a very data-driven narrative.

- **Mainstream News Agencies**: Articles from Reuters, Aol, and Newsweek (e.g., 2025-04-688054769, 2025-04-688069323, 2025-04-687905649) present the event as a dramatic cosmic phenomenon that revises earlier theories, making the science accessible for a general audience. They tend to simplify complex scientific data for readability and may dramatize the narrative to capture attention, potentially glossing over uncertainties.

- **Tech/Pop Culture & Alternative Media**: Outlets such as Yahoo, Space.com, and Gizmodo (e.g., 8630131899, 8629850698, 8633122576) favor a more sensational and entertaining retelling, highlighting quirky metaphors (like a star 'burping' after eating a planet) to underscore a twist in initial theories. Their emphasis on humor and catchy language may lead to oversimplification and a narrative that prioritizes entertainment value over nuanced scientific accuracy.
