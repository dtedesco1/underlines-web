# Colossal’s Dire Wolf: De-Extinction or Designer Gray Wolf?

In April 2025, Colossal Biosciences announced the birth of three wolf pups engineered with 20 gene edits from gray wolf DNA to mimic the extinct dire wolf, sparking fierce debate over species resurrection versus genetic modification.

#### Focusing Facts

- Three pups—Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi—were produced using CRISPR edits on gray wolf DNA, implanted into surrogate dog mothers.

- The process involved 20 targeted gene modifications based on ancient DNA from a 13,000‐year-old tooth and a 72,000‐year-old inner ear bone.

- Experts dispute the classification, with some calling the animals engineered gray wolves rather than true dire wolves.

#### Context

Colossal’s project recalls earlier controversial conservation efforts, such as the 1995 reintroduction of gray wolves in Yellowstone, where technological intervention reshaped ecosystems but sparked intense debate over human manipulation of nature. Much like Dolly the sheep’s cloning in 1997—which challenged our definitions of natural life—this dire wolf project blurs the line between de-extinction and genetic modification. Over the next century, as science further probes the balance between ecologically sustainable conservation and high-tech fixes, this moment highlights both the promise and the peril of engineering species without addressing the underlying decline of habitats and ecosystems.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Biotech Innovators and Pro-De-Extinction Advocates**: They view the creation of dire wolf proxies via genetic editing as a breakthrough that can eventually aid conservation efforts, advance scientific understanding, and pave the way for rewilding extinct species. Their enthusiasm may overlook ecological risks and ethical concerns while downplaying that the animals are not genuine de-extinctions but genetically modified proxies, influenced by technological optimism and investment interests.

- **Conservation Critics and Scientific Skeptics**: They argue that the project is more about rebranding a genetically modified gray wolf as a dire wolf rather than truly resurrecting an extinct species, and caution that it diverts resources from protecting living biodiversity. This perspective may emphasize conservation priorities and potential unintended ecological consequences while being skeptical of novel biotechnologies, possibly driven by a traditional scientific caution and conservation ethos.
