# Israel’s Gaza Assault Intensifies Amid Troop Shortages and New Buffer Zones

Facing reserve fatigue and declining troop participation, Israel renewed its offensive on March 18, implementing new security zones and corridors in Gaza while diplomatic and humanitarian crises escalate.

#### Focusing Facts

- Combat unit reservist participation has fallen to between 60% and 70% due to exemptions and prolonged conflict fatigue.

- The Israeli military secured the 12-km Morag axis and expanded buffer zones in northern Gaza, displacing hundreds of thousands as part of a strategy to pressure Hamas.

- Since October 2023, over 51,000 Palestinians have been killed, with ICC arrest warrants issued for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Gallant.

#### Context

This event resonates with historical military recalibrations seen in protracted conflicts, such as Israel’s realignments after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when strategic vulnerabilities forced doctrinal shifts. The current assault, marked by troop shortages and forced displacements, reflects systemic issues in conscription and morale similar to past challenges in modern warfare. Over a century, conflicts have repeatedly revealed the limitations of relying solely on military tactics without a parallel diplomatic avenue, underlining long-term trends in statecraft and civil-military relations. Whether this recalibration will alter the enduring cycle of regional conflict remains uncertain, but it signifies a critical juncture in an ongoing struggle with profound implications for both military strategy and humanitarian law.

#### Narrow Perspectives

- **Israeli Official Perspective**: This perspective emphasizes Israel’s military strategy as a necessary response and focuses on operational challenges, such as troop shortages and strategic adjustments in Gaza. It may downplay or justify the collateral damage and humanitarian fallout in favor of national security and defense imperatives.

- **Anti-Israel Humanitarian Critique**: This perspective condemns Israeli actions as aggressive and destructive, highlighting the severe humanitarian toll on Palestinian civilians and framing the military offensive as disproportionate. It tends to emphasize Israel’s culpability in civilian suffering and war crimes, potentially overlooking or minimizing the strategic concerns cited by Israeli authorities.
